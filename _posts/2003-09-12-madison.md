Iâ€™m in New York City. Yes it is true; I flew to NYC on the 11th and yeah it was creepy.  

Yesterday we visited Ground Zero. Today was a lunch with Zeldman and tonight box seats at Yankees Stadium.  

Tomorrow will include frolicking around towards and around Times Square.  

Photos are being taken by the buckets.  

See you Sunday.
