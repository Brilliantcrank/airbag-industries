This is the one, most disturbing lie I caught last night:



<div class="block"><span class="caps">KERRY</span> — Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, “Where is Osama bin Laden?” He said, “I don’t know. I don’t really think about him very much. I’m not that concerned.”  

<span class="caps">BUSH</span> — Gosh, I just don’t think I ever said I’m not worried about Osama bin Laden. It’s kind of one of those exaggerations.</div>What? Hold the phone Shrub, even I remember this one and I’m sure your crack communications team almost passed out when you said it.



<div class="quote">As I say, we haven’t heard much from [Bin Laden]. And I wouldn’t necessarily say he’s at the center of any command structure. And, again, I don’t know where he is. I — I’ll repeat what I said. I truly am not that concerned about him.  

[President Bush](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020313-8.html) — Whitehouse Press Conference, March 13th 2002</div>What else did I miss?
