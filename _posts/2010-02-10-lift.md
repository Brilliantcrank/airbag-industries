Time for a quick history lesson about the [Marine Corps Air Station Tustin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Air_Station_Tustin):



<div class="quote">The Air Station was established in 1942 as Naval Air Station Santa Ana, a base for airship operations in support of the United States Navy’s coastal patrol efforts during World War II. NAS Santa Ana was decommissioned in 1949. In 1951, the facility was reactivated as Marine Corps Air Station Santa Ana to support the Korean War. It was the country’s first air facility developed solely for helicopter operations. It was renamed Marine Corps Air Station Tustin in 1970. By the early 1990s, MCAS Tustin was a major center for Marine Corps helicopter aviation on the Pacific Coast. Its primary purpose was to provide support services and material for the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing and for other units utilizing the base.</div>Tomorrow a few of us at Happy Cog West will be hanging out in the shadows of the airship hangars. Come on by and say hi from 5-7PM over at [JT Schmids](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=embed&hl=en&geocode=&q=2415+Park+Ave.,+Tustin,+CA+92782&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=57.684464,128.144531&ie=UTF8&hq=2415+Park+Ave.,&hnear=Tustin,+CA+92782&cid=13938615200590564663&ll=33.721341,-117.819614&spn=0.130928,0.140419&t=h&z=13&iwloc=A).
