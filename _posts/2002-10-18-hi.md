 “Greg Storey from Tustin, Calif., pitches his own blog Airbag with a quote from Jim Coudal: ‘…Airbag is a rare thing. A beautifully designed and smartly written weblog.’  
 I’ll add to that endorsement by saying that the posts on this blog are interesting, entertaining, and easy to digest.” — Will Femia, <span class="caps">MSNBC</span> Weblog Central  
 Welcome <span class="caps">MSNBC</span> readers please take a look around. To your left are links to some of Airbag’s best entries. On your right are a few samples from the Shutterthumb No Film Display.  
 I hope you enjoy your experience here at Airbag.
