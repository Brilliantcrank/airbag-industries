Normally we sit in the very back – row 14 when it’s just me and the rocket scientist; row 13 when we’re with friends. The last car is the best position to have maximum fun because there is no lag over the ‘hills’.  
 It’s been our favorite ever since we became annual passholders four years ago.  
 Riding is best at night because you don’t have as many landmarks to orient yourself with, adding to the excitement and the exhilaration.  
 Sadly something went wrong last Friday and the make believe run away train stopped pretending. And someone died because of it.  
 We drove ten miles to Disneyland to have dinner, maybe catch a ride, and see for ourselves what might have happened. But the ride sat dark and silent behind a brand new wall of freshly painted plywood that kept everyone from getting anywhere near Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.
