Does anyone else think that the look of Tiger’s [Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html) should be turned into a [Mac theme](http://www.macthemes.net/reviews/themes.php)?  
 On a side note, it’s really a shame that [Apple continues to rip off software](http://www.konfabulator.com/) from their own developer community. Where I come from this practice is called stealing and those who commit the act are usually sent to jail.
