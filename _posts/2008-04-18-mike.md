Two big announcements from Cameron this morning. Authentic Jobs, the best damn jobs listing site on the whole Internet has added [a generous affiliate program](http://authenticjobs.com/affiliates/) and [a whiz bang <span class="caps">API</span>](http://authenticjobs.com/api/) (you can see an example of this in action over at Jeff’s [big brown wonder](http://jeffcroft.com)). Anyone who owns a website that speaks to interactive designers and developers would do well to participate in both of these new programs. As someone who has supported Authentic Jobs since day one, it’s great to see Cameron’s business take this next step.  
 Now, who wants to start pool on how long it will take 37signals to respond in kind? I’ll put money on the squares for 8, 12, 24, and 29 hours.
