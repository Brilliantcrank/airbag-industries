Scott Kidder, an employee of Gawker Media, a former (his words, not mine) Weblogs Inc. competitor, asks: “[How many blogs did <span class="caps">AOL</span> buy, exactly?](http://www.scottkidder.com/2005/10/how_many_blogs.php)”  
 I would say <span class="caps">AOL</span> wasn’t exactly looking to buy blogs but was more interested in acquiring really smart people to show them how the game is played. Obviously blogs like [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com) and [Autoblog](http://www.autoblog.com/) help sweeten the deal (they make money) but I would hedge a bet that what <span class="caps">AOL</span> really wanted — what they really paid money for — was the intellectual capital contained within the walls at Weblogs, Inc.  
<span class="caps">AOL</span> still has a lot of exclusive content and it’s a major component of Time Warner’s online media conglomerate. With the decline of <span class="caps">AOL</span> and seeming lack of a unified method for Time Warner to effectively manage their huge catalog of content online, It makes sense that they were looking for a way to improve their digital real estate in order to increase ad revenue and blogs are ‘it’.  
 Of course I’m speculating but it seems odd to think that all <span class="caps">AOL</span> really bought was just a network of blogs. Then again maybe the You’ve-Got-Mail Glee Club was just looking to throw money at some web 2.0 buzzwords.
