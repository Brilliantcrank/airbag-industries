Note to self: Consider taking a break from writing about anything related to this election because as much fun and passionate as it was with previous elections, this one is has turned into a complete circus.  
[I mean when the candidate is from Wasilla, Alaska why should this come as a surprise really?](http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/ab547fc8-d96d-4f87-aa8a-2e52be2b66fc.htm)

<div class="quote">We have been blessed with five wonderful children who we love with all our heart and mean everything to us. Our beautiful daughter Bristol came to us with news that as parents we knew would make her grow up faster than we had ever planned. We’re proud of Bristol’s decision to have her baby and even prouder to become grandparents. As Bristol faces the responsibilities of adulthood, she knows she has our unconditional love and support.  
 Bristol and the young man she will marry are going to realize very quickly the difficulties of raising a child, which is why they will have the love and support of our entire family. We ask the media to respect our daughter and Levi’s privacy as has always been the tradition of children of candidates.</div>My apologies to all. I thought I was speaking up for common sense and decency…and apparently I spoke too soon?  
 Time for this Hulk to go smash into a stiff drink and hope that his head will stop shaking in disbelief sometime today.
