Hewlett-Packard, that personal computer maker that [wants to be so hip it hurts](http://murtaugh.tumblr.com/post/1054481), has announced [they have acquired Logoworks](http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070424006399&newsLang=en), a company that sells clip art as logos. The move was made in order to “provide small businesses with access to professional design solutions at a fraction of market cost.”  

Says Vyomesh Joshi, executive vice president, Imaging and Printing Group, <span class="caps">HP</span>:

> Today’s small businesses are increasingly turning to the web for marketing tools and services that strike a balance between affordability and quality, by adding Logoworks’ web-based graphic design service to our portfolio, <span class="caps">HP</span> can now provide the right mix of cost savings, flexibility and professional quality to help make a small business look big.

Making small look big is so vital to good business and <span class="caps">HP</span> knows it.  

The technology giant is rumored to be making even more acquisitions in order to help inflate organizations around the world. Analysts predict <span class="caps">HP</span> will soon offer their own line of products to include: Viagra, Hummer <span class="caps">H3</span> (likely to be called Hummer <span class="caps">HP</span>), platform shoes, breast implants, North Korean hair dryers, and Mac Pros.
