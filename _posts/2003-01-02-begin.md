With a new year beginning there are several matters at hand…  
 First the close of old business that includes an afternoon long hunt for receipts and invoices needed for documents labeled 1099 and 1040.  
 New business entails a quick ten minute introspective on how things went in ’02 and if there are any changes that need to be made for ’03. This also includes a review of the Sunday Church Attendance Policy which until now has read, “No Thank-you”.  
 Then comes planning and development, both here at home and at work, for many new projects that will see the light of day this year.  
 There is also the matter of the <span class="caps">SXSW</span> and [Bloggies](http://www.fairvue.com/?feature=awards2003) competitions for which I hope to achieve a honorable mention. That would be dandy.  
 Travel to New York, Chicago, Austin, Las Vegas, and Yosemite.  
 And somewhere around all of this I will need to see *The Two Towers* at least four more times.
