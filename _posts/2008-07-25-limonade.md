Everything about design is drama. The process, the people, the product, all filled with drama. So I suppose it’s a natural fit as the subject of a reality television series (as if reality television can somehow be associated with the word natural).  
[Leading lemmings into the fire is non other than Phillpe Stark.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/24/bbc.television)

<div class="quote">[Philippe Starck’s School of Design](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schoolofdesign), a working title, will see the Frenchman—whose work spans everything from windmills to chairs, hotels to toothbrushes and yachts to beer bottles—invite 25 would-be designers to bid for one of 10 places on a design course in Paris.</div>Pity, I would have called the show: French Eye for The Anything That Can Be Sold In Target Design Stooge.

<div class="quote">The successful applicants will be given the chance to demonstrate their abilities by working on real design projects, with Starck gradually whittling down the class. At the end of the course at least one student will be rewarded with a six-month placement at Starck’s design agency in the French capital.</div>What the…call the kettle hypocrite…back in May—as in just a few months ago—[Stark declared that design is dead, a “dreadful form of expression”](http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=080327175559.tvacjlyi), and then went on to regret the part in his life wherein he designed everything from cars to catheters.

<div class="quote">I was a producer of materiality and I am ashamed of this fact. Everything I designed was unnecessary. In future there will be no more designers. The designers of the future will be the personal coach, the gym trainer, the diet consultant. I will definitely give up in two years’ time. I want to do something else, but I don’t know what yet. I want to find a new way of expressing myself…design is a dreadful form of expression.</div>So I guess when you’re having a pity party…when the face staring back at you in the Phillipe Stark Bathroom Mirror™ is old, frumpy and is designed with more gray hairs than desired the thing to do is to have a heart-to-heart with the International press and then seek out a television deal.  
 Touché Monsieur Starck, touché.
