I’m not sure what all the brouhaha over 37signals’ [Declaration of Independence from Adobe](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop) is all about. They design safe, bare-bones, boxy, Volvo-esque web based applications. Hell if all I had to do was make boxes all day for my own products then I’d drop Bloatshop in a heartbeat.  

If your design aesthetic is similar to that of the boys in Chicago—and clients are willing to pay you really good money for the Boxy but They’re Good Chique—then I’d certainly heed their advice, otherwise why should any of us care what a box factory says when we’re in the landscaping business?
