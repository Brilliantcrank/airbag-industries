As much as I would love to take the day off and spend that time reading, writing, and conversing, I must report in to the man.  
 Don’t click away just yet dear reader!  
 I was able to find a shortcut to introduce a topic that has been on my mind lately. It comes from Michael who co-writes for the wonderful site, 2<span class="caps">BLOWHARDS</span>.

> Michael writes —  
>  “Are you as amazed as I am at how many political blogs there are? Thousands and thousands, it seems. May political discussion flourish on the web, of course. Still, I’m even more amazed by how drastically they outnumber culture blogs. Are there so few people interested in cultural matters? Could it be that culture-minded people still hesitate to use computers? Or that computer-ish people are unlikely to be interested in matters cultural?”

Take a minute to [read the entry and continue the worthwhile discussion](http://www.2blowhards.com/archives/000573.html#000573).
