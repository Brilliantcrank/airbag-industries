The topic has often been discussed, mud slinging back and forth, the type of talk often over heard in a small town auto garage owned by someone named Joe. Many hours spent ‘kicking the tires’ and test driving different models and brands to help make a difficult decision easier (as if).  
 A suddenly, rather abruptly (but with sound mind and body), the choice is made.  
 On order, a brand new Powerbook G4 clocking in at 800 MHz, *with* Jaguar installed (saving this author 1-2 hours of time otherwise wasted waiting for an installation to finish) will arrive September 2, 2002.  
 And so the prodigal son returns.
