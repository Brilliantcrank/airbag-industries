In an effort to draw more attention to a story that some of you may have already heard, I have spent more time than I should have to try to put together words that will drive a response from you. I have failed to write a successful narrative that begins with a meaningful backstory, relatable to you, so that when I come to a conclusion, you, filled with empathy and emotion, feel absolutely compelled to act and share the story within your sphere of influence, but in an attempt to be clever I have wasted too much time.  

Lame.  

So let me get to the point: [Carolyn Wood](https://twitter.com/carywood)—someone you have likely never heard of before—a quiet, but important member of our community is in dire need of help from all of us.  

If you make things for the digital world (World Wide Web, mobile, etc.) then [you owe some part of your career to Carolyn.](http://alistapart.com/article/help-one-of-our-own-carolyn-wood) She has worked mostly behind the scenes, [helping the community at large express, present, and distribute ideas, strategies, and tactics on building a better world](http://www.pixelingo.com/#past-projects)—a better career path for you and I. This may come across as hyperbole but I assure you it is not. Many of the quintessential books and articles that have steered our industry in the right direction.  

If you use the Internet directly through a web browser or possibly indirectly through an iPhone app, you have Carolyn Wood to thank. She has worked to support the community that creates compelling arguments and supportive statements that foster curiosity, innovation, and conversation that lead to many of the delightful experiences that you and I enjoy.  

There is a hard working, very smart, important, kind woman who has been there for all of us, albeit in a small, maybe obscure but impactful way and she now needs our help and support. I hope I have held your attention enough that you’ll click through and [help Carolyn Wood](https://www.youcaring.com/carolyn-wood-585895)—please contribute what you are able either financially or through sharing this story to your network. We have to get this done; we can’t fail those who’s hard work helped pave the way for us to enjoy better careers and experiences.
