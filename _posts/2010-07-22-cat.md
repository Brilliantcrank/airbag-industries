As if the world needed one more reason to appreciate <span class="caps">NPR</span>, I found one more. [In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Vivian Schiller, president and <span class="caps">CEO</span> of <span class="caps">NPR</span>, had this to say about the design of their iPad application:](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704764404575287070721094884.html?mod=WSJ_Tech_Above_Video)

<div class="quote">The trick there for all media organizations is not just say, “Here is what it looks like online, so we’re just going to plop it down on the iPad,” but to think about how you use the device and design something that suits it. <span class="caps">NPR</span>‘s iPad device doesn’t look anything like our website. It doesn’t look anything like our iPhone, but is really suited for that particular screen size and form factor.</div>Wow! I wish more executives took the time to learn and understand core principals of design and function as it relates to the experience. Sadly, the reality is that every year there will be at least one time that you and I will have to fight the good fight because a client or in-house executive thinks their ten-second intuition knows best.
