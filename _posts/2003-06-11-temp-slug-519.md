Ah so Ghyslain is on the rise to fame and glory ala the Blair Witch Project.  
 You [remember Ghyslain](http://www.gregstorey.com/airbag/archives/000584.shtml#000584), the spunky Canadian kid who is also a Jedi Knight.  
 It looks like [the Cartoon Network has hired him for his acting talent and mastery of Jedi lightsaber combat skills](http://www.adultswim.com/webcam/gal_mov/sg_kid/index.html). His first acting job was to recreate the very magical moment that has earned him fame and fortune (and an iPod) around the globe.  
 Only this time he if fully prepared with a way better outfit (check out the cape!) And, uh, a beard?  
 Itâ€™s moments like these that I am forced to make a decision: stay on the day job or go get a camcorder and record myself into a better future.  
 Now I just need to find a cape.  
 And maybe grow a beard.
