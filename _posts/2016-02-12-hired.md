One evening, eleven years ago, I got an instant message from [Cameron Moll.](http://cameronmoll.com) He asked if he could show me some work he recently completed. After agreeing to keep what I was about to see a secret, he sent over a hyperlink. I clicked the link and got my very first look at [Authentic Jobs.](https://authenticjobs.com)  
 Cameron had a history of posting design jobs to his blog. Those posts became so popular that employers and recruiters started sending him emails asking to have their job listing posted. Seeing an opportunity, Cameron, got to work creating one of the first job boards devoted to our trade.  
 That evening, he also showed me a new addition to the sidebar of his blog featuring links to the last five job listings. Wanting to help a friend, I asked how I could put that list on my site, Airbag. As I recall, Cameron seemed slightly confused that someone would want to help promote his site, but a few weeks later I got the code and happily added it to my site.  
 That gesture turned into an opportunity to join the advisory board for Authentic Jobs. I served for ten years, happily peppering Cameron with ideas and thoughts on how to expand market share and revenue. Not every suggestion made it through the Storey Filter, but enough did to make me feel like a worthwhile contributor to the team.  
 Though I resigned from the advisory board a year ago, I am still a big supporter and fan of Cameron and his team. Last night the guys deployed a brand new Authentic Jobs that has been a long time coming. Itâ€™s a big improvement, and the team should feel proud.  
 With that in mind, a heartfelt congratulations go to [Cameron, ](https://twitter.com/cameronmoll) [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamjspooner), and [Myles](https://twitter.com/myles). Nice work boys.
