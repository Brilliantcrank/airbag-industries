Entering the small office, looking at the gentleman, my co-worker, from Mexico I ask, “Hey Mak, do we get Martin Luther Jr. Day off?”  
 Mak, who has seen more knife fights, hubcaps, and gang-symbols in his life than I ever will replies, “If you are a minority then, yes, you get the day off.”  
 Checking his calendar, staring at the fine print, “But if you’re white, you have to go to work.”
