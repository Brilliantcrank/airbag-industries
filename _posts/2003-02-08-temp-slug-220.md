Airbag is fast approaching the 1000th comment mark and to celebrate the occasion I have decided to give away a $25 Amazon gift certificate to the person who pushes discussions over the millennium mark.  
 There are, of course, some rules and restrictions.

> 1. The winning comment must be written in English. It must have something to do with the current thread. It must be coherent, gibberish will only get you a smack on the head, not free stuff from Amazon. Also, the winning comment must be made to the top 5 entries &#151 if I get one more person asking me if I know how to [hack into hotel television](http://www.gregstorey.com/airbag/archives/000109.shtml) I’m gonna find the nearest bell tower and ready the dear riffle.  
>  2. Have fun.

Or — read, write, don’t be an idiot, and win!  
 Good luck.
