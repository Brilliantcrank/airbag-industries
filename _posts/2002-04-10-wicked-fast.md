After serving my sentence at California Superior Court, and after having to explain, very carefully, to my homies in Santa Anna who Erick Estrada is and why a fellow ‘Latino’ would be caught dead playing a traffic cop, I went right to the computer store and bought a new toy.  

It’s a snappy Hewlett Packard zt1130 designed for Windows <span class="caps">XP</span>. I now have four more days before I can return it back, no questions asked, no restocking fee.  

But I think this ones a keeper.  

Running at a glorious 1.13 gigahertz, the baby can also play Return to Castle Wolfenstein with 128 megs tied behind the back. And when I click on apps, nothing bounces around it just opens and rather quickly I might add.  

Now Apple still has my heart but I just realized that unlike some monks, I don’t have to torture myself while using a computer. Okay, okay, it’s not that bad and I can, like totally, still respect myself in the morning after using a Macintosh the night before.  

Few notes about turning to the ‘Dark Side’:  

1. Airbag will now be called Darth Airbag and will feature the latest in respiratory gear.  

2. The soon to be launched 415th Recon will now be hosted at: *msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dnoxpta/us r/415rcn/html/index.asp* instead of *www.gregstorey.com/recon*. Cool eh?!  

3. For some reason when I try to pull up Slashdot or Userland I keep getting Error 1984? That’s a new one on me?!  

4. Forget handcoding! Have you seen what Microsoft Word <span class="caps">XP</span> can do with <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">XML</span>? Wow!  

Now keep in mind that I have not totally converted. I still have my trusty Apple Macintosh G3 (Blue & White) to keep be bi-platform lingual. I’m hoping to learn how to use things like Apache, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, MySQL, and the ‘teh-teh-ter-min-al’.  

I do have a few questions for Airbag readers. Please put <span class="caps">XP</span> thinking cap on now. Ready? Okay!  

I want to get my hands on Lucida Grande for Windows. Do you know who makes this font (or carries the license) and where they sell it? I grew to love it (the font) while using MacOS X and would like to bring that charm to <span class="caps">XP</span>.  

And is it possible to convert Macintosh Postscript Type I fonts over to windows?  

And if a woodchuck, could chuck wood, how much does a woodchuck chuck?
