Every year we play Christmas music that was part of our childhood seasonal experience. For me this means listening to two albums in particular: John Denver — Rocky Mountain Christmas and John Denver & The Muppets – A Christmas Together.  
 Wrapping gifts, watching the lights sparkle on the tree and drinking egg nog would not be the same without listening to John serenade *Christmas with Cowboys* or hearing Miss Piggy belt out ‘Five Golden Rings’ during the *Twelve Days of Christmas*. These songs have such a strong attachment — they are like another member of the family.  
 In the last ten years the wife and I have added Bing Crosby, Reindeer Room I & II, Charlotte Church and some rendition of the Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite to our annual repertoire, but John and Kermit will always be in heavy rotation.  
 I think it’s safe to assume that not everyone grew up listening to Captain Grape Nuts every December so I’m curious what music you play each and every year as part of your Christmas tradition.
