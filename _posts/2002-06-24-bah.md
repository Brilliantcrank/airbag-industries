I just discovered that my HP zt1130 – formerlly wonderful – laptop doesn’t support OpenGL, thus preventing me from playing Neverwinter Nights.  
 After crying like a small child for about 45 minutes I have come to the conclusion that indeed I may need to go back to MacOS and Apple, who makes computers that support OpenGL!  
 Maybe if I act fast enough I can get into Apple’s [Switch](http://www.apple.com/switch/) campaign.  
 UPDATE – Perhaps not being able to play NWN is such a bad thing right now. Seems they are having some serious [bug problems](http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=62060&forum=49&sp=0#650041).
