What’s the best under $5, under 0.7mm roller ball pen in the world?  

I’ve had one too many Sanford Uni-ball Micro 0.2mm Rollers explode all over my fingers and hand for no apparent reason other than poor manufacture. I’m looking for the kind of pen you can sign peace treaties or trust your life with.  

For example: say you were stranded in Neverland and had to write the sheriff for help because Michael was getting ready for a ‘bed time story’ — at that momment what pen would you abolutely want by your side in order to craft and speedy but elegant looking plea for someone to come and bust a cap in the King of Pop?  

Oh and it would be nice if it came in Cobalt Blue.
