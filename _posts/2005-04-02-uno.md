Yesterday I consumed more meat products than I normally eat in a week. I don’t know how the good people of Chicago avoid having heart failure on a day-to-day basis. Maybe they do, but it doesn’t seem to slow them down.  
 While walking through the Navy Pier last night the wife pointed out an emergency defibrillator strapped to the wall. Where most cities have fire hydrants, Chicago has electric heart therapy devices. I looked for a coin slot but found none, apparently it’s free for everyone to use. Chicago, what a great city, free heart defibrillation for everyone!  
 We’re going to the the Lincoln Zoo in a bit and after yesterdays exploration in Chicago cuisine I won’t be surprised if I see the monkey and dolphins snacking on italian beef. It will be interesting to observe if chimps will try <span class="caps">CPR</span> first or just reach for the paddles.
