After watching last night’s West Wing it’s obvious that these two things will happen in the season premiere next fall:

<div class="block">1. Alan Alda will become the next actor to play the President of the United States. I couldn’t be happier with this casting.  
 2.Toby will be seen wearing an orange jump suit for leaking knowledge of a top-uber-secret military space shuttle program to the press.</div>What remains a mystery is how the writers will shuffle the rest of the cast into retirement without changing the show’s fast pace and turning into a small end-of-show soap opera.
