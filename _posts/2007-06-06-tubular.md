I’m all for designers trying to break out of their shell but this [Dwayne-Wayne](http://www.thesportstruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/kadeem-hardison-as-dwayne-wayne.jpg) ink blot created for the [2012 Olympics](http://www.london2012.org/) is a cruel fraternity prank. After looking at this work for the first time I wondered [how many paint chips does a person have to eat to think this is brilliant work](http://coudal.com/olympics.php)? Fifteen (with lead of course) or five-thousand (latex non-glossy)?

 I mean seriously, what, huh? uh, are you sure this is it…really? So the real one, oh, this is the real one? Pink and yellow? Will there be a version for board shorts? Yes, I’m sure it does look good on a pair of Vans. Does this have anything to do with the 25th anniversary of Fast Times at Ridgemont High? No? Just a coincidence, eh? When did they legalize marijuana in London? Is that French ice skating judge somehow involved in all of this?  
 Thankfully there is more to London than day-glo rorschach tests and it might, just might be possible that after more work is unveiled this will all start to come together but somehow I doubt it. When it comes to Olympic logos and design systems, make mine [Otl Aicher](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joekral/231669020/in/set-72157594264686838/).  
 At least his work didn’t induce [epileptic shock](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6724245.stm).
