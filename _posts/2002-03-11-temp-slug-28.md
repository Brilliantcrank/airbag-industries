It’s that day of the week again where good things come from Brown Ground.  

Farscape War Torn #2 completes a short two issue story that has been a good read so far though I wish the author wouldn’t make the Crichton character such an idiot, he’s not that way on the TV series so why do it here? Issue #2 of the limited Taskmaster book will be a must buy. The cool artwork of Udon makes this Ironman tale a lot of fun. Lastly, I recommend JLA adventures even if you have the Cartoon Network. Like Batman: The Animated Series, the book follows the plot of the original <span class="caps">TV</span> show but doesn’t copy it so you get the best of both worlds.
