After all the travel I did this year I’m going to hop on [Kottke’s meme](http://kottke.org/09/12/my-year-in-cities-2009). Long story short, I had to endure airport security way too many times. There was a time when I was flying an average of two flights every week. That said, [Jared “Travel Machine” Spool](http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/) made my flight schedule look like a series of grade school field trips. Still, I’ve got enough free drink coupons to last for a long, long time and a handy A-List Membership card that lets me jump to the front of the line for Federal Flight Safety Processing Happy Fun Time.  
 Here is a list of the places I traveled to and stayed in for one or more nights in 2009.  
 Aliso Viejo, California <sup>1</sup>  
 Emeryville, California <sup>1</sup>  
 Palm Springs, California <sup>2</sup>  
 Palo Alto, California  
 Pasadena, California  
 Walnut Creek, California <sup>2</sup>  
 Yountville, California  
 Fort Collins, Colorado  
 Boston, Massachusetts <sup>2</sup>  
 Albany, New York  
 Eugene, Oregon <sup>2</sup>  
 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania <sup>2</sup>  
 Austin, Texas  
 Seattle, Washington <sup>2</sup>  
 Tacoma, Washington  
 Sadly, I wasn’t able to make my annual trip to Las Vegas in November—a problem I hope to remedy not too long after New Years.
