Right now there are millions of 14 year old boys who idolize Justin Timberlake for the very first time. In case you missed it, the pop star boy wonder and his partner Janet Jackson fell victim to a ‘wardrobe malfunction’ during the Superbowl Halftime show produced by <span class="caps">MTV</span>.  

During the ‘accident’, Justin reached over Janet’s chest and riped down and across the front of her outfit, effectively (and expertly I might add) removing enough clothing for Ms. Jackson’s breast to get a bit of fresh air.  

All on live television.  

For you french visitors, this doesn’t happen normally in the United States and it’s quite against the law. So maybe you can understand that it came as a shock to millions of people.  

What I don’t get (and this is what really bugs me) is why <span class="caps">CBS</span>, <span class="caps">MTV</span>, or Justin Timberlake would think we’re stupid enough to believe this was an accident. All three parties were a little too quick to issue statements of apology for me to believe it wasn’t [planned from the beginning](http://www.drudgereport.com/mattjj.htm). Read what Justin had to say about the event:



<div class="quote">I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl,” Timberlake said in a statement. “It was not intentional and is regrettable.</div>Wardrobe malfunction? Dude, is that all you got?  

Anyone who watched this on television could see that Justin was either trying to remove clothing or tear her arm off.  

Governor Schwarzenegger has a name for this move and it’s far from being called a ‘malfunction’.  

<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: [<span class="caps">FCC</span> has launched an investigation in the matter](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=492&e=1&u=/ap/fbn_super_bowl_jackson). Go get’em Colin Jr.!
