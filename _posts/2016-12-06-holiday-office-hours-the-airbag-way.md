[Dustin Senos](https://medium.com/@dustin/holiday-office-hours-92ea96e6c29f), former Head of Design for Medium, and all around good guy came up with a pretty cool idea after a bit of introspection.

> As the year comes to a close, I’ve been reflecting a lot on my career, the future, the past, and the present (2016, you’ve been a doozy.) When thinking about companies I’ve had the chance to work with, and the people I’ve met, I always come back to how thankful I am for those who took me under their wing. The people who took a risk hiring me when I was young and inexperienced, the people who supported me taking on more responsibility later in my career, and the people who took the time just to chat. My career exists because of those people.

Looking back at my early career I too had a handful of supportive mentors during school and at work (I could use one now come to think of it). More recently, I have enjoyed building up and continuing to mentor nearly one-hundred early career designers, developers, and offering managers at <span class="caps">IBM</span> Studios around the world.  

Inspired by his career reflection, Dustin came up with [Holiday Office Hours](https://medium.com/@dustin/holiday-office-hours-92ea96e6c29f#.p6x90pmch)—a way to give back by arranging eight hours of time in thirty minute blocks over the holiday break to provide consultation for “people who may be in school, getting into the industry, new to design or engineering, or struggling with their first tech job.”  

Once I caught what Dustin was up to and why I joined up along with Noah and a growing list of industry professionals.  

So, as long as you don’t work for IBM (because you all already know how to find and schedule my time), sign up for a time slot and lets talk*. I’m happy to answer any questions you have and give what advice I might have after being in the industry for twenty-plus years.  

**I removed the link because all slots have been taken. Given the response I’m going to consider doing this again soon, but after I get through the initial round of sixteen discussions. Follow this account and [@brilliantcrank](https://twitter.com/brilliantcrank) for future**
