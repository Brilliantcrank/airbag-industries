I am on my way to pass inspection so that I may sit in a small cell for seven hours. Once my time is up I will be magically transported to the frosty cold climate of Southcentral Alaska.  
 Alas my time will be short and I will be back Monday in order to prepare for a week long trip to Northern California for the holiday season and my brotherâ€™s wedding.  
 What are your holiday plans?
