Well after installing Movabletype 3 times now I thought I knew it all. Thought I had covered every step. That is until I remembered that directories need certain permissions before this whole picnic will opperate correctly. Duh!  

Besides, how in hatti are you supposed to pronouce CHMOD? Not even Leo, my server administator, has an idea. It canâ€™t be anymore difficult than Linux which is supposed to sound more like Lee-nooks than Lie-nuks.  

So here I am, up and running MT 1.4 and it looks very good. Not like the olden days with version 1.0. Kudos to the Trotts on the new default templates. Now, on to the old installation where all my customization is kept. Cross my fingers, click my heels, and away I go!
