To kick off a great year [Cameron](http://www.cameronmoll.com/) is doing something a bit different with his annual promotion over at Authentic Jobs. Normally I don’t dedicate an entire post to such events but I do like to support a good cause every now and then.

<div class="quote">We’re calling it the [Twenty Ten](http://www.authenticjobs.com/blog/2010/01/twenty-ten/) promotion. It works like this: [Post a listing between now and January 22](http://www.authenticjobs.com/post/) and you’ll receive 20% off your listing. More importantly, 10% of your purchase will be donated to [Charity:Water](http://www.charitywater.org/) to help bring clean and safe drinking water to people in developing nations.</div>To participate use code <span class="caps">AIRBAGTEN</span>. Hire someone cool, help a village develop a source of fresh water. Win, win.  
 You may also join in and donate to the campaign independent of posting a listing. [Cameron and the Team AJ are hoping to raise $5,000](http://mycharitywater.org/p/campaign?campaign_id=3206), which is enough to fund the development of a freshwater well in one village.
