Whoa. Was that a roller coast ride or what? Damn! My stomach is still in knots, a sign of a fantastic ride, but I don’t think I will want to get back on any time soon. Seventy percent voter turn out. Wow!  

I’m not bitter, maybe a little dumbfounded. I mean how gay marriage is more important than people dying in war, I will never understand.  

A few weeks ago a friend of mine had the same conclusion that another four years might not be as bad as the first four. I thought it was interesting that Newsweek writer [Michael Hirsh](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6398886/site/newsweek/) made the same point today:

> …there is every possibility that Bush’s second term might prove to be different from his first, especially in foreign policy. And it won’t be more radical (that may not be possible). Indeed, perhaps the only consolation for Democrats who saw Bush as a dangerous departure from centrist foreign policy is that he must now clean up the mess he has made.

Great lets start cleaning the Department of Homeland Security or what I like to call Homeland Stasi.  

I’m really bothered by how much of a Police State our country has turned into. This really hit home this morning while waiting to greet some clients at Union Station. I had 30 minutes before their train arrived and so I started taking some pictures of the area. I started taking  

a few when I heard someone yell, “Hey. You. Hey!” I kept looking through the view finder trying to frame another shot when I was approached by a LA County Sheriff. He asked what I was doing, to which I replied that I was waiting for some friends and taking pictures while waiting.  

He then asked to see identification.  

My first instinct was to tell him to go to hell because last time I checked, taking pictures of trains was not against the law. But I didn’t feel like asking clients if they minded meeting me in prison, on the other side of a fiberglass wall.  

So I gave it to him while he explained to me that Amtrak and Metrolink do not want people taking pictures of their trains. I didn’t even bother to ask why because I’m sure it had something to do with the Patriot Act I or II, which one are we on now?  

Anyway, how stupid is this? Being treated as if I was a terrorist sympathizer taking intel photos for the next hit? Me, white as white can be, red hair and blue eyes?!  

The officer stared at my drivers license while he continued; if I wanted to take pictures I had to register at some Amtrak office so cops would know that I had permission, which is cop speak for “non-threat”. And with that he let me go providing I stopped taking photos.  

Yeah, God Bless America alright. I’m sure he really loves this country right back with all the lies, deception, hate, and secrecy so prevalent in our country today.
