President Bush’s approval rating just took another step down. [Less than one third of the nation approves of his natural born decidership.](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/24/bush.poll/index.html "CNN.com - Bush's approval ratings slide to new low - Apr 24, 2006") Gee, what a surprise.  
 To the eighteen-plus-percent who have swung to this side of the fence in the last two years: welcome, we’re glad you have come to your senses. Many of us (forty-nine percent) wonder why you re-elected this boob in the first place, but all is forgiven, we’re glad you could make it.  
 Now, what do we have to do to get this approval ratings number lowered, or is that the sole responsibility of the President?
