I’m heading for Seattle to see [fish fly](http://www.pikeplacefish.com), the [very first Starbucks](http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/thompson/11e/case/starbucks.html), and a sister in law who knows that [Soylent Green](http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&cf=info&id=1800119839&intl=us) is people. Perhaps a side trip to Vancouver if I’m lucky, but a stop at that [book store](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/) is a must.
