With all this talk about [blog popularity](http://www.kottke.org/03/02/030209weblogs_and_.html) I have decided it’s time to get Airbag on the A-List.  
 None of the helpful suggestions from [Anil Dash](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/005114.php) seem applicable to Airbag, so I came up with a sure fire way to be more popular.  
 I’m going to buy my way to the top.  
 Airbag is fast approaching the 1000th comment mark and to celebrate the occasion I have decided to give away a $25 Amazon gift certificate to the person who pushes discussions over the millennium mark.  
 There are, of course, some rules and restrictions.

> 1. The winning comment must be written in English and it must have something to do with the topic. Your comment must be coherent, gibberish will only get you a smack on the head not free stuff from Amazon. Also, the winning comment must be made to the top 5 entries &#151 if I get one more person asking me how to [hack into hotel television](http://www.gregstorey.com/airbag/archives/000109.shtml), I’m gonna close this content shop for good!

Or,

> 2. Read, write, don’t be an idiot, and win!

Good luck.
