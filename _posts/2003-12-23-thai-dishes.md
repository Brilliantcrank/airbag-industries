Today was a great day. One of those moments in history I’ll remember vividly when people will ask, so what got you started?  

Tomorrow I’ll be in Austin, roaming the hills while chit-chatting with my wonderful mother-in-law. We’ll share war stories about the mouth-breathers we’ve had to work with or encounter in the last year. Our motto: <span class="caps">Save the Atmosphere, End Mouth Breathing</span>. Posters should be made.  

Sometime around the start of 2004 a new website, domain, dog-and-pony show, and a plan to run for President of Cuba will all be unveiled.  

Thank you to one and all who frequently visit and comment here at Airbag. Merry Christmas everyone! And have a Happy New Year.
