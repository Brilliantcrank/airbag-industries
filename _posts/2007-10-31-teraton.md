Seeing a lot of [bru-ha-ha over the little <span>5.6</span> earthquake](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-quake31oct31,1,687517.story?coll=la-headlines-california) that occurred in San Jose yesterday. Mostly from the new kids who aren’t used to the ground moving hither-to-and-fro on its own accord, because nothing under a <span>6.4</span> is really anything to write home about.  
 So to you fault line-living n00bs I say: welcome to the Ring of Fire. You’ll never get more than a two-second warning, so there’s no need to worry needlessly. If the earth shakes, it shakes — just ride it out as best you can and hope it’s not going to turn into a <span>10.0+</span>.  
 Also: Trick or treat, smell my feet, give me something good to eat.
