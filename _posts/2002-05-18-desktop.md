You will find today’s entry as submited to the [Hivelogic Visitor’s Screenshot Library](http://www.hivelogic.com/visitor/). It’s the blue one second from the top and on the right.  
 It will take a bit to load the image but I think you’ll like the entry. Also, Dan really really wants people to participate in the gallery so take a minute and download one of his nifty [Hivelogic Desktops](http://www.hivelogic.com/desk/) and then send a screenshot in.  
<span class="caps">Update</span>: Once you have landed at the Visitor Gallery, you have to click on the desktop image, wait for it to load, then read the entry.
