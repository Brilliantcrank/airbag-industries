It took almost all of the political capital I have to get a transcript of the jury deliberation in the Marth Stewart case. As most of you know, Martha will now be busy making stripes the new black. So I thought it was important to make sure she was tried fair and square by her peers.  

Here is an excerpt:



<div class="block"><span class="caps">PRESS: </span>An inside trader! An inside trader! An inside trader! We’ve got An inside trader! An inside trader!<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>We have found an inside trader, might we burn her?



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>Burn her! Burn!



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>How do you know she is an inside trader?



<span class="caps">JUROR #2: </span>She looks like one.



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>Bring her forward.



<span class="caps">MARTHA: </span>I’m not an inside trader.



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>But you are dressed as one.



<span class="caps">MARTHA: </span>They dressed me up like this.



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>No, we didn’t… no.



<span class="caps">MARTHA: </span>And this isn’t my nose, it’s a false one.



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>Well?



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>Well, we did do the nose.



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>The nose?



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>And the hat — but she is an inside trader!



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>Burn her! Inside trader! Inside trader! Burn her!



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>Did you dress her up like this?



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>No, no… no … yes. Yes, yes, a bit, a bit.



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>She has got a wart.



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>What makes you think she is an inside trader?



<span class="caps">JUROR #3: </span>Well, she turned me into a newt.



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>A newt?



<span class="caps">JUROR #3: </span>I got better.



<span class="caps">JUROR #2: </span>Burn her anyway!



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>Burn! Burn her!



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>Quiet, quiet. Quiet! There are ways of telling whether  

she is a inside trader.



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>Are there? What are they?



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>Tell me, what do you do with inside traders?



<span class="caps">JUROR #2: </span>Burn!



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>Burn, burn them up!



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span> And what do you burn apart from inside traders?



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>More inside traders!



<span class="caps">JUROR #2: </span>Wood!



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span> So, why do inside trader’s burn?



<span class="caps">JUROR #3: </span>Be’cause they’re made of wood…?



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span> Good!



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>Oh yeah, yeah…



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span> So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>Build a bridge out of her.



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span>Aah, but can you not also build bridges out of stone?



<span class="caps">JUROR #2: </span>Oh, yeah.



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span> Does wood sink in water?



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>No, no.



<span class="caps">JUROR #2: </span>It floats! It floats!



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>Throw her into the pond!



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>The pond!



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span> What also floats in water?



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>Bread!



<span class="caps">JUROR #2: </span>Apples!



<span class="caps">JUROR #3: </span>Very small rocks!



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>Cider!



<span class="caps">JUROR #2: </span>Great gravy!



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>Cherries!



<span class="caps">JUROR #2: </span>Mud!



<span class="caps">JUROR #3: </span>Churches — churches!



<span class="caps">JUROR #2: </span>Lead — lead!



<span class="caps">District Attorney: </span>A duck.



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>Oooh.



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span> Exactly! So, logically…



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>If… she.. weighs the same as a duck, she’s made of wood.



<span class="caps">JUDGE: </span> And therefore—?



<span class="caps">JURY FOREMAN: </span>An inside trader!



<span class="caps">PRESS: </span>An inside trader!



</div>Given the circumstances, I’d say she got off pretty good. Now if we could only find that evil, woodsy, floating, duck-like, warlock Steve Case.
