For the last two weeks there have been Xserves lying on a table behind my desk, roaring to go. At first this arrangement wasn’t too bad, the fan noise was more than I was used to but this was only a temporary arrangement so I tried not to mind. Now, just thirteen days later, I find myself making sure to keep hydrated, listening to headphones, and browsing through catalogs of products I have no intention of buying (like <span class="caps">NFL</span> licensed beard clippers, wine-cork bulletin boards, and popcorn vending machines. Seriously, who in the hell uses bulletin boards anymore?)  
 Today the [Boeing <span class="caps">7G5</span>s](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brilliantcrank/91277234/) are taking off to their final destination where they will live in a comfy, insulated community with strict covenants. While I’ll miss looking at these luxury boxes, I know they’re going to be happy making new friends and living under the safety that only Halon gas can provide. And just in time too, yesterday, without thinking, I waited for a safety demonstration before setting off to work.
