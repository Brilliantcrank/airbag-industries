I’m at home today, watching President Bush speaking to small business owners about the economy, Iraq, et cetera. He was welcomed to the podium by a proprietor who has the same linguistic eloquence as our victorious leader.  

In response to her fumbled and cheerleader like greeting, my wife was heard to remark, “What kind of monkey butt introduction is that?”  

My wife rocks the caspah.
