I don’t get global perception of my country, the United States of America. Take the Olympic’s for example. Canada, or as Homer Simpson says, America Jr., was robbed of 1st place standing because judges were fixing the competition. Then the US steps in with news coverage (I guess other countries just chose to ignore this?) of the event that pressured the IOC to step in and demand action.  
 But instead of global joy it turns into a pointing and name calling match against the US. Folks, we didn’t even place. The US didn’t have a stake in this at all, we just saw something wrong and spoke up about it. Can someone tell me why helping your neighbor is scandalous?
