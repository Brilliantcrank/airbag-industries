Tuesday afternoon ended with the completion of a two day Flash MX class.  

Lately it’s been hard to find a place and time where I am not distracted by work, the gorgeous rocket scientist, impeachment of that piece of crap Grey Davis, and Gameboy Advanced SP.  

On Monday morning I met [Matthew Pizzi](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672324016/102-7788144-9003337?v=glance), who provided enough solace and guidance to learn the very basics of Flash animation components. I made a square morph into a circle which lead to a old-thyme flickering countdown clock, which begat an exploding 3d box.  

The animation, or movie creation process, is simple enough. Each animation is composed of a set of smaller animated movies — everything has it’s own timeline. There appears to be no right or wrong way to create a movie, just a few techniques to help save bandwidth and production time.  

Thanks to [Zeldman’s book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018/ref%3Dnosim/airbag-20/102-2879717-8564159) I have a clear guide on how <span class="caps">XHTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span> should be structured to work the best in most browser environments. Now I know Flash doesn’t have browser issues, you can either view it or you can’t, but I’m left to wonder if one movie structure is better than all others.  

If so I would prefer to practice those methods now, rather than have to buy another orange book which basically says everything you are doing with Flash is wrong.  

Not that I mind constructive criticism, I’m just trying to save time.  

Any advice is appreciated.
