“So what do you want to do tonight?”  
 “Watch the season finally of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it’s a two hour show!”  
 Ooohhh cccrrraaappp! What in the hell am I going to do with two-hours-of-*sigh*-Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer?!

<div class="l50">*Phoomp* — You should go get Greek take-out and have a lovely evening with your wife.</div>But Buffy? Do you have any idea how much I do not want to watch that?

<div class="right"><div class="r50">*Phoomp* — Don’t fall of that lovely evening crap! Remind her of all the homework she needs to do.</div></div>Hmm, play the Guilt & Responsibility Card, that’s always a sure bet.

<div class="l50">For shame! You’re wife works so hard at her studies, give her a well deserved break!</div>Yeah, but what’s in this for me? I work hard too.

<div class="l50">Well that’s certainly relative.</div>Hey! You are starting to annoy me and what’s with the glowing? Stop it, you’re hurting my eyes.

<div class="right"><div class="r50">Look, if she wants to watch Buffy, fine but let her watch it later, like around 2AM, when you are in a deep sleep.</div></div>I got a better idea, lets buy this copy of *A Bridge Too Far* and go watch it in the office on the laptop.

<div class="l50">But what about cuddle time on the couch?</div>Well, okay but do I still have to watch Buffy?

<div class="l50">Yes.</div>Take care of him while I go and pay for this.

<div class="right"><div class="r50">Already on it.</div></div>
