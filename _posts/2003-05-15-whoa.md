After work last night I grabbed the iPod, a copy of [*Stop Stealing Sheep*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201703394/qid=1053057375/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-3235668-9299013?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) and took my place in line with the other geeks and dweebs — all of us in line to see Neo kick some virtual butt in the Matrix.  

I thought I had come prepared, at least more than I was for waiting in line for Star Wars Episode I.  

Yet I was reminded how old I am getting as the group in front of me came fully prepared with two Xboxs – linked for multiplayer goodness. Several more groups huddles around the blue glow of laptops as they watched the original movie while eating delivered pizza.  

While the movie was good ([read David Edelstein’s review](http://slate.msn.com/id/2082928/)), I was more impressed with all the entertainment being had back in the line.  

At least now I have a real need for a silver Gameboy Advanced <span class="caps">SP</span>.
