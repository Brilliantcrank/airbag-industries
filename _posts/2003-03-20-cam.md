I’m watching a reporter broadcast live from the passenger seat of a <span class="caps">HUMVEE</span> that is following a tank brigade as they speed across the Iraqi desert. The video and audio are both as tolerable as watching broadband video on a <span class="caps">DSL</span> modem.  

Simply amazing.  

I’ve witnessed a lot of remarkable events live on television, but the logistics and technology required to pull this particular broadcast is just too damn cool. I wonder how long it will be before we will be able to send video to friends and family from across town or across the world as it happens.  

‘Reality’ television be damned.
