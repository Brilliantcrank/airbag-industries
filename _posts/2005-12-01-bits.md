This morning I received my second [Free Delivery](http://www.iconbuffet.com/delivery) from Iconbuffet, each from different people. I don’t know how this got started but now I’m hooked. I have access to Shanghai Tech and Taipei Night Market for which I am willing to trade for Oslo Atmosphere and Finance. It might be that no one has access to these yet, in which case let me be the first to stand in line.  
<span class="caps">UPDATE</span> — Mission accomplished. I have to hand it to Josh and the peeps at Iconbuffet, they found a way to make icons a viral community tool. That’s just as brilliant as Dodge, who made it cool for macho men to drive [station wagons](http://www.dodge.com/magnum/index.html).
