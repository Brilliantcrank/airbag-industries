I have been around the web long enough to see more than a few website come and go. I don’t mean the dot-coms, they can come and go as they like. I’m referring to independently produced web sites, be they blogs, magazines, or sites that never really fit into one category or another.  

For one reason or another, these creative works have come and gone. And while the web is better off today for the time these sites were public, I sure do miss them.  

Here are the top three:



<div class="block">[Life Uncommon](http://web.archive.org/web/20020205070615/www.lifeuncommon.org/journal/) — Dawn’s photography of Chicago allowed me to explore her hometown without having to leave me seat. The photos are still available, but on a [different site](http://chicagouncommon.com/). I miss her writing on design, metropolitan living, and baseball (go Cubs!). I also recall that Dawn would often completely redesign her website at a moments notice for two reasons. First because she’s extremely creative and second, her designs have been ripped off more than any other personal site I know of. Extremely creative that girl.  

[Unplugged](http://web.archive.org/web/20020610030621/www.jonwiggens.com/MT/index.html) — I found Jon Wiggen’s site through the recently updated list at Moveable Type back in the early, early days — back then there were only about forty registered websites. Jon was living in Germany and his site was filled with fantastic photographs and stories of life in Hamburg. Even after he moved back to Vancouver, his site continued to entertain. Jon is also an avid gamer and a Mac fan, so he always had plenty of great links to information and unique applications. I still keep in touch with Jon via chat and email, but his website is sorely missed.  

[High Five](http://web.archive.org/web/19971222081825/highfive.com/core/index.html) — Before there was A List A Part, there was High Five. It was the Internet’s first widely read web design magazine. Created by web design pioneer David Siegel, High Five was the original design magazine with site reviews, designer interviews, and feature articles on upcoming technologies that would help make the web a better medium. You can sum up the spirit of the magazine with these words found an old about page: “We don’t have to remind you that a well designed web site is a rarity. We encourage designers to sweat the details in order to start banishing the garbage. Good design wins!” Classic.</div>What sites do you miss that have come and gone? And what do you miss about them?
