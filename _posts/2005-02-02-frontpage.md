Call me superstitious but it seems that designers are off to a bad start for 2005.  
 It all started with Jason’s [fighting off design stagnation](http://designinflight.com/issues/jan/articles/26.html). Then Dave went public with some wisdom for [getting unstuck](http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2005/01/17/getting_unst/). Only a few days later, Dan shared that he has found that [wine consumption can help enhance the creative process](http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2005/01/19/wine.html). And this morning Nazarin greeted February with his [methods for pushing past a blank Photoshop screen](http://www.weightshift.com/memo/old/2005/02/02/oh_design/#more).  
 What’s going on here? Is there a strain of creative malaria going around that <span class="caps">AiGA</span> hasn’t warned us about? I suppose tomorrow the news will report that all the designer vaccine form Canada has gone bad.
