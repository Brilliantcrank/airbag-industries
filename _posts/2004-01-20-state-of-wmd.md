Tonight is the State of the Union. Thursday night belongs to [Frontline](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/) as they investigate the failure of the Bush administration’s hunt for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. You may recall, it was the alleged possession of <span class="caps">WMD</span> by Saddam Hussein that became the primary reason for going to war almost a year ago.

<div class="quote">When President Bush speaks to the nation in tonight’s State of the Union address, he’ll no doubt remind Americans of what the administration has accomplished since his address a year ago. But one thing, at least, will be conspicuously absent from the president’s list: the discovery of the weapons of mass destruction that were his primary stated reason for going to war with Iraq.  
 For the past seven months, the Iraq Survey Group — a special coalition military and intelligence unit headed by Dr. David Kay — has been scouring Iraq for some trace of the illicit weapons and weapons programs that virtually everyone (even Jacques Chirac) believed Saddam Hussein was hiding. But so far, Kay and his team have found no conclusive evidence to back up the pre-war claims.  
 This week, in “Chasing Saddam’s Weapons,” Thursday, Jan. 22 at 9pm on <span class="caps">PBS</span> ([check local listings](http://www.pbs.org/tvschedules/)), <span class="caps">BBC</span> reporter Jane Corbin, who has covered the issue of Saddam’s weapons for more than a decade, offers an unprecedented inside look at the hunt for Iraq’s alleged WMD. With exclusive access to top-secret locations and key officials — including David Kay — Corbin tells the story of the Iraq Survey Group’s frustrating and mostly fruitless search since last spring, and reveals new details about what the <span class="caps">ISG</span> has, and has not, uncovered.</div>Five-hundred Americans have lost their lives in search of <span class="caps">WMD</span>. Countless thousands of Iraqi’s lost their lives defending <span class="caps">WMD</span>. Australia, Poland, Italy, Spain,and other countries have lost soldiers and statesmen in search for <span class="caps">WMD</span>. Even the Japanese have mobilized their military, for the first time since World War II, in support of this war of <span class="caps">WMD</span>. Keep this in mind as you watch President Bush paint roses and peaches about our future and our progress.
