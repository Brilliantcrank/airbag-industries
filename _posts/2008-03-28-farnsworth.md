Each week, no matter the condition of the weather, the color of Ethan’s mood ring, or the extra hours it will take to meet our deadlines, we call each of our clients. We check in, ask how they’re doing, and give them an update on the activities surrounding their project. We call every week throughout the project, and even two to three weeks past the time we’ve delivered our work—all to make sure the client doesn’t have any last-minute needs, or has run into any problems.  
 That’s how we roll. We care like that.  
 This afternoon, we talked to a client who’s been working with our templates for about a week. When asked if they were still happy with the work that we had done, the client replied thusly:  
<span class="quote">We’ve been tearing our hair out looking for things that you guys did wrong.</span>  
 That’s always nice to hear.
