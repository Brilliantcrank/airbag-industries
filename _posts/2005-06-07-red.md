Dear hk@hkoffice.dns0755.net,  

I’m sorry but I do not know you from Internet, or from Adam for that matter, but I am pleased to meet you.  

An advertising factory, you don’t say. Boy-howdy!  

Does J. Walter Thompson know about you? I bet they would love to know that China has turned the advertising business into a conveyer belt operation with red robots, cheap labor, and scores of Communist propaganda creative experience.  

Golly, with that kind of firepower I guess the world will soon lay at your feet. And with that in mind I can assure you that I also look forward to mutual cooperation between us.  

If I may humbly ask, Mr. Leo, lordship sir, when you take over the United States through your advertising factories and armies of Walmart employees and goods, can I have Texas?  

I should think we can rename it Internet and finally know each other from there.  

Sincerely,  

Greg
