Yesterday [a Hindu chaplain was jeered by protesters](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/congress_usa_prayer_dc;_ylt=AsLCpnOrg5R37OkAq.trwwADW7oF) while providing the opening prayer for Congress (the first ever recited by a Hindu).



<div class="quote">Capitol police said two women and one man were arrested and charged with causing a disruption in the public gallery of the Senate. The three started shouting when guest Chaplain Rajan Zed, a Hindu from Nevada, began his prayer.  

They shouted “No Lord but Jesus Christ” and “There’s only one true God,” and used the term “abomination.”</div>Asshats.  

These people, and anyone who thinks what they did was a good idea, need to be remind of a few things.  

First, the Freedom of Religion that they enjoy so much, that they seemingly take for granted, extends to all religions—it’s not singular—never had been nor should it be.  

Second, if you seek to squash the practice of any religion then you endanger the freedom to practice all religion. Once intolerance of one religion enters public policy then you can kiss it all goodbye.  

Lastly, if you want people to join your belief system, public demonstrations of hate and exclusion are not the way and I’m pretty sure Jesus didn’t think so either (see New Testament, all the words in red).  

It’s all about the [Beatitudes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatitudes) morons.
