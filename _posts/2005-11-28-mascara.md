Well this is pretty cool, the Smithsonian is blogging, specifically the [Smithsonian American Art Museum](http://americanart.si.edu/index3.cfm). Their new blog, called [Eye Level](http://eyelevel.si.edu/) will cover the history, evolution, and current events in the American art world. The site was built to attract collaboration among curators, conservators, historians, enthusiasts, critics, designers — pretty much anyone who wants to talk American art.  
 Airbag reader and friend Jeff Gates, Lead Producer on the project, wrote me this morning:

<div class="quote">When the Smithsonian American Art Museum reopens its renovated historic main building in July 2006, it will be a showcase for American art that celebrates this nation’s vision and creativity. <span class="caps">SAAM</span>‘s blog Eye Level (eyelevel.si.edu) is part of the museum’s continuing effort to explore the stories central to the American experience and to search for what connects Americans today.</div>…If this doesn’t make it on Coudal, nothing will…

<div class="quote">Using the museum’s collection as a touchstone, the conversation at Eye Level will center on the ways in which the nation’s art connects to its history and culture. The discussion will extend beyond works at the Smithsonian American Art Museum to include other collections, exhibitions, and events.</div>While I have yet to see a post on the [Puffy Shirt](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61463-2004Nov18.html), I think this kitchen-table dialogue about American art is going to be a win-win.  
 As part of this grand opening be sure to read [In Stereo](http://eyelevel.si.edu/2005/11/in_stereo.html), in which the author recalls a co-worker’s recent outing in Washington D.C. — more please.
