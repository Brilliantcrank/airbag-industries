I have found [Return to Castle Wolfenstien](http://www.planetwolfenstein.com/) to be extremely addicting. More so than the Tivo in my living room (I’m still watching Simpsons re-runs). I’m only playing the demo (it’s not out yet for Macintosh) but you can’t beat this team-based multiplayer game. The sounds are fantastic and really bring you into this virtual reality of a world-war II battlefield. It’s nothing like the real thing but in many ways it comes so close.  

Hopefully, eventually, [Warcraft III](http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=4955) will be released sometime this year. It’s been a long time since part two and from the beta testing reports and new screen shots, I think its going to be a banner year for Blizzard. I just hope they can work their network problems encountered with Diablo II. Nothing sucks worse in a game than slow ping rates during an intense battle.  

Last week I picked up the core rule books for [Star Wars RPG](http://www.swrpga.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi) by Wizards of the Coast. The books were 50% off so I figured it was a win-win situation. Now I just need to find people to play with who love to game but also strive to go beyond the gamers stereo-type. I have heard of people playing via Internet by email and instant messenger but so far I have not been able to find where these people gather. If you have any idea where playas hang then please post a comment, I will understand (smirk) if you don’t use your real name.
