[Michael](http://binarybonsai.com/) told me to:

1. Grab the nearest book.  
2. Open the book to page 23.  
3. Find the fifth sentence.  
4. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.

From [Against All Enemies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743260244/airbag-20) by Richard Clarke:
