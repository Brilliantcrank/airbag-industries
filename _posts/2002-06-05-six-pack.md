1. Tired of doing the ‘mans’ work while on the job? Head over to Yahoo! Movies and play [Snapcount](http://movies.yahoo.com/movies/feature/sumofallfearsgame.html), a Flash version of *Risk* that was made to promote the new movie *Sum Of All Fears*. The game is actually pretty good a nice distraction without all the waiting and fussing from human opponents.  
 2. Kristian Walker, the man behind the blog – [Thinking Around the Corners](http://www.eurekaville.com/thinking/blog), launched his [new magazine](http://www.eurekaville.com/thinking/), of the same title, today. Thinking Around Corners has been a friend of Airbag and I wish him the best of luck but I don’t think he’ll need it from me with a feature like an [interview with Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.eurekaville.com/thinking/interview_main.html). Nice work!  
 3. I’m trying something new called [Blogrolling](http://www.blogrolling.com), but I have to admit that I don’t really understand what this new app does. I do know that when the sites – featured under Independents Day, on the left – are updated, Blogrolling will buy an exclamation mark to indicate fresh content. If you or anyone you know has a clue on the other features of this, great?!, new blogapp please let me know.  
 4. Dan Benjamin has decided to minimalize in the extreme with a new redesign of [Hivelogic](http://www.hivelogic.com). I would like to see more ‘blog’ sites will experiment with new layouts and find a ways around the typical blog design. Dan’s taken a nice step in that direction.  
 5. Tsk, tsk. I thought I had the goldmine idea when I discovered that Mini CDs that were the same size as those used by the shinny new Indigo [Nintendo Gamecube](http://www.planetgamecube.com) that now slaps my Tivo around. With the write burning software I was sure my game inventory was going to skyrocket within a matter of days. Unfortunately, the small gaming wonder uses Mini DVDs that cannot, at least currently, be copied. Heaven is smirking at me right now.  
 6. Saving the best for last, if you have not seen the *Late Night with Conan O’Brien*, Star Wars bit then stop what you are doing now. [Download this Window’s Media file](http://people.bu.edu/lypham/triumph_starwars.wmv) [17.2m] and prepare to laugh long and hard. The piece, in which a hand puppet dog talks with, but mostly insults, a large number of geeks who are waiting in line to see Episode II, is non-stop fun and puts [*Trekkies*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120370) to shame.
