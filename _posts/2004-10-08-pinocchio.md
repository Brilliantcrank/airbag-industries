What is the one thing either of the presidential candidates could say tonight that would win you over?  
 Personally I’d register Republican and slap an [Enron/Halliburton ’04](http://airbagindustries.com/bucket/enron_halliburton_04.jpg) sticker on my butt if Bush promises to pull our troops out of Iraq and launch a full scale invasion of France — right after he fires that United Nations sanction-loving-freak Colin Powell.
