“Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society–the federal government, state and local government, the private sector and the American people,” — President Bush  
 Dear Mr. President, securing ‘cyberspace’ (did you really use the word ‘cyberspace’?) is relatively easy to do and I am surprised none of your staff knew this before hand. Let me save you some hassle.  
 Here are the steps necessary to protect ‘cyberspace’:  
 If you are using Windows XP:

> 1. Click the Start button in the lower left corner of the screen.  
>  2. Click on Control Panels.  
>  3. Click on Network and Internet Connections.  
>  4. Click on Network Connections.  
>  5. Right click on your active Network Connection and choose Properties.  
>  6. Click the Advanced tab.  
>  7. Click the box next to the words, “Protect my computer and network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet”.  
>  8. Click <span class="caps">OK</span>.

If you are using Mac OS X:

> 1. Order and iced latte because Jaguar is already protected. Yehaw!

See how easy that was!  
 Now you can spend more time dealing with the poor economy, Hydrogen cars, Alert Condition Orange, and less time worrying about ‘cyberspace’.  
 On this one, we’ve got your back Jack.
