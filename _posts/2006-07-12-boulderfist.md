Joi Ito once said that [World of Warcraft is the new golf](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/02/10/world_of_warcraft_the_new_golf.html). While I donâ€™t think most people in the business world would agree I have been surprised by how many clients and contractors are playing. The problem is that everyone is scattered across various servers making it impossible to play the back nine in Astrannar or talk shop in Orgimmar.  
 Now that Blizzard has enabled [character transfers](https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-transfer-intro.html) lets see what we can do to get everyone in the same realm. What server(s) are you on, designate Horde or Alliance, and what server(s) have you heard of others moving to?
