I’d like to personally commend <span class="caps">NBC</span> for screwing up yet another of the Olympics opening ceremonies. <span class="caps">NBC</span> is the world’s gold medal champion in providing sucktacular coverage of one of humanities better events. Surely we can do much, much better than this.  
 I especially like how Bob Costas and Katie Couric feel compelled to narrate everything about the ceremony. And I really, really loved how they spoke over Bjork’s entire performance — assuring the audience that the athletes were not going to die while being covered by a giant parachute. Weeeee!  
 Robert, Katherine you are both giant asshats.  
 Just once I would love to sit behind these twits on Broadway and provide my own dialogue, bloated commentary, and useless factual tidbits during a performance. I ask myself how much more can <span class="caps">NBC</span> suck and the answer is none more, <span class="caps">NBC</span> could not possibly suck none more.  
 Maybe I’ll go visit Canada where I can [see an event without the crap](http://www.slate.com/id/2105148/).
