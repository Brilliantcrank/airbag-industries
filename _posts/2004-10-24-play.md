Watch this — [Singer Ashley Simpson misses her lip sync que on Saturday Night Live and then walks off stage.](http://www.collegehumor.com/news/ashlee_snl.wmv) Real swift. Ranks right up there with Faith No More in the All Time Best <span class="caps">SNL</span> Musician Performances category.  
 Does anyone besides Elton John perform live anymore?  
 The only band I would rather they did lip sync is Aerosmith. Sure they’re old and maybe don’t sound as good as they did in their prime but the Stone can still throw some songs in front of a live audience without the use of a karaoke machine. I like Aerosmith but Steve can’t sing live for crap, but at least he tries.  
 What’s up with new recording artist these days? Are they really talentless hacks in a computerized post production world?
