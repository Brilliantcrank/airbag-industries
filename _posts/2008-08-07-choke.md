You can bet good, hard earned money that the Rocket Scientist and I are going to be glued to the <span class="caps">HDTV</span> to watch the opening ceremonies, because anyone with a soul can’t…not…watch. Despite all the geopolitical, economic, steroid injected crap that comes up each and every time Bob Costas gets measured for a NBC Sports jumpsuit, I always, whole-heartedly buy into the notion that during these next two weeks we’re a planet, not a bunch of borders.  
 That said, as much as I will enjoy <span class="caps">NBC</span>‘s multi-channel 24/7 <span class="caps">LIVE, OMG</span> coverage, the Summer Olympics can suck smog because anyone with a brain knows that the Winter Olympics are where it’s at.  
 See you in Vancouver, two years from now.
