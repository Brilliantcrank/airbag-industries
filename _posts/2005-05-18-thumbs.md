What a sweet time to be a gamer. With all three platforms having announced their new hardware lineup, all that is left is to gawk at the games they make possible. [And gawk we will.](http://www.gametrailers.com/e3_2k5.php) Killzone 2 and Ghost Recon 3 both look amazing, in fact I don’t think I’ve seen a nextgen game trailer that looks marginal.  
 Admittedly I’m having a hard time believing that the Playstation’s chipset can beat Xbox’s three <span class="caps">G5</span> processors?! Nor do I grok how the Xbox 360 doesn’t melt from all the heat of those <span class="caps">G5</span>s when you consider that Apple put brick size heat sinks on top of their processors to keep things from liquifying.  
 Leaving those questions to science, I’m hoping to get my hands around a 360 controller at <span class="caps">E3</span>. I’d also like to get some time with a Playstation 3 but I don’t think Sony is ready for that step yet — let’s hope their [controller design](http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000620043567/) is still a work in progress. Last year’s huge software show was amazing and with all the industry unveilings this year I can’t imagine how crazy its going to be. The hardest part will be going home.  
 On another note, I haven’t seen any pre-show press for Blizzard. I hope they have something planned that will improve World of Warcraft. The new <span class="caps">PvP</span> Honor System sucks rocks and it has significantly altered the game-play in a way that has crippled the entertainment value.
