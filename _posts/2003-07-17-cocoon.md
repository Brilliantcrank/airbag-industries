A co-worker once remarked to me that old people should be turned into food to help feed a much younger generation. His argument followed that after a certain age a human ceases to become a productive member of society and therefore should just give up the ghost and call it a day.  
 Keep in mind this guy lives in a remote village on a large island off the coast of Alaska. He has a lot of time to formulate ideas with the five other people living inside his head.  
 I was reminded of this yesterday as I watched Mr. Weller, 86, hobble behind his lawyer looking very unaware and uncaring that he had just [killed 9 people and injured 45](http://www.msnbc.com/news/939947.asp?0cv=CB10) (some still in critical condition).  
 What pisses me off is that this probably could have been avoided. Here is a guy who has lived his whole life, he is on the down slope of a bell-curve, and his recklessness managed to destroy persons who had much of their life still ahead of them.  
 No alcohol or drugs, just a natural lack of brian synapses.  
 You know, Whoop-see Daisies.  
 I believe itâ€™s time the federal government should take action and prevent further preventable catastrophes.  
 We should reverse course and quadruple the budget for [<span class="caps">SETI</span>](http://www.seti.org/about_us/Welcome.html) with the new mandate of finding [Brian Dennehy](http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&cf=info&id=1800049037&intl=us).  
 Once we have made contact he will come, gather our older population, and take them into space where they can live happy and no where near a moving vehicle.
