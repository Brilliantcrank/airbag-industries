Is it just me or has the news media undergone a small transformation in a manner that we haven’t seen in a while?  

I just finished watching a clip of [<span class="caps">CNN</span>‘s Anderson Cooper take Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu to task](http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/09/01.html#a4740), cutting through her casual Washington gibberish. Visually displeased with the Senator’s remarks, Cooper throws back questions to her with a rare, angry tone.  

Even [<span class="caps">FOX NEWS</span> has been affected](http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/09/02.html#a4763) — it’s real, must-see <span class="caps">TV</span>.  

Is it possible, that as a result of this tragedy, our [fourth branch of government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_branch_of_government) might re-emerge from this with a new resolve and candor? Or will it return to business as usual, reading press releases and asking pre-prepared questions when complacency is likely to return?
