Redesign is moving right along. I look at the present design and want to get rid of it as soon as possible.  
 Meanwhile I’m battling it out with MacOS 10.3, which doesn’t seem interested in it’s relationship with a wireless connection. It’s almost like a high school romance: on and off again depending on the weather, the outcome of an episode of Miami Vice, or how fresh the Red Vines are.  
 I’ve tried switching in-between an Airport Extreme base station to a Netgear MR314 wireless router but neither holds the fancy of Panther.  
 Such is life in an annual $130 upgrade world.  
 I’m heading to the beach. Hopefully the moon is still pulling the tides around.
