 Itâ€™s Friday, and a slow one at that.  
 As an exercise in milking the clock I checked the referral statistics to find that Airbag is being swept by [Garst.com](http://www.garst.com). The domain forwards to Net Identity which tells me that Garst.com is a shared domain and that I can get an email address using said domain.  
 Of what business does an email company have in lurking through all the entries of this site?  
 Awkward.
