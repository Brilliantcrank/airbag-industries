 This is so wrong in so many ways: violent murder victims being ‘honored’ with free french fries, a $1.29 value.  
 When America invades Iraq and people die will I get a discount from Pizza Hut? Or will McDonalds give us all a free cheeseburger for every Iraqi military target obliterated?  
 What the hell is going on?
