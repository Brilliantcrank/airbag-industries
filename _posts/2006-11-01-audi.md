Every morning in October has been a twelve step program and I’m looking forward to a few weeks of life without an alarm clock, without a clock at all. In a matter of hours I will shutdown this computer, stow it in a safe place, zip the luggage closed and begin a journey to Europe. This adventure, free of the Internet, will involve planes, trains, automobiles, and a ship traveling across five countries. So goodbye The Internets, twelve hour days, and constant phone meetings, I’m going on vacation and I suggest you do the same.  
 While I’m out consider taking this time to riot in the streets, participate in democracy, and have a Jello Pudding Pop while watching Venture Bros.
