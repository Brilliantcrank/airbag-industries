From [<span class="caps">MSNBC</span>](http://www.msnbc.com/news/877972.asp):



> “A complex of angular buildings and a 1,776-foot spire designed by architect Daniel Libeskind was chosen as the plan for the World Trade Center.  

>  The new building is planned to be taller than the trade center towers, which briefly stood as the world’s tallest at 1,350 feet. Libeskind’s tower also would surpass Malaysia’s 1,483-foot Petronas Twin Towers, the tallest buildings in the world.”



I don’t have a real attachment to the design of the World Trade Center (like a New Yorker would) but I never liked any of the proposed replacement designs. I hope that Daniel’s vision for this new collection of buildings and monuments looks a lot better than the pictures of his white models.  

Irregardless, it would be nice if they can start construction soon and begin to patch one, of many, rips in America’s current fabric.
