<span class="caps">EXT. CAMPAIGN RALLY – ON STAGE – DAY</span>



<div class="blank">In the parking lot of a closed down auto factory people have just heard the <span class="caps">Oxford Stateman</span> deliver a speech on how their jobs have been out sourced to Arkansas because the current President is a righteous boob. In the background people are still cheering and waving signs in support mostly because they have no where else to go because they are unemployed. To his right the <span class="caps">Royal Heirs</span> looks flustered and confused. In the distance cows moo.</div><div class="caps" style="text-align: center;">Royal Heirs</div>John, John… John, if you become President, where will I go? What shall I do?
