So what’s the deal with [<span class="caps">SXSW</span> 2006](http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive) — what [panels](http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/) are you looking forward to and why? Without knowing who’s presenting what it’s a bit too hard call at the momment, but Monday looks like the best full day line-up.  
 And if anyone knows what Web Wrestling is, please, do tell.
