I know a lot of Tiger users love Dashboard widgets, perhaps if you are one of them you can explain how these little clumps of HTML and Java are of any real use to you. While they certainly look nice I can see no practical use for them as they are merely hacks of larger, more powerful applications. Dashboard seems to be nothing more than extremely watered down version of Sherlock, but perhaps Iâ€™m missing the point.  
 And why does Apple make such a [big deal](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/) over these application fragments? Instead of showcasing just another way to lookup local weather conditions why not showoff how MacOS X only applications like [Quicksilver](http://www.nouvellepatrouille.net/quick_back.html) are changing the way people use computers and interact with web applications in a way Windows XP can only dream of.
