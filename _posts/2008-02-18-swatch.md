Not a day goes by wherein the factory at Airbag Industries is completely shut down and we’ve got a lot to show for it, just not quite yet. I’m very proud of the work we’re doing and wanted to show you all a sample of our efforts from the last sixty days.

 Eventually I’ll formally introduce you to all of these projects but for right now I have to get back to the grind.
