From <span class="caps">TIME</span> magazine comes insight into [what Ruby on Rails does](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1622565,00.html):

> To help build Basecamp, Campfire and the company’s other core applications, [David] Hansson developed Ruby on Rails. It gives 37signals’ software a consistent look: sleek, friendly and without the extraneous bells and whistles that plague much of the bloated software sold by larger companies.

True, I’m not a programmer but lets makes this clear, Ruby on Rails has absolutely nothing—zero, zip, zilch—to do with the look of applications and websites. Sorry <span class="caps">TIME</span>, you still need to hire designers to do that kind of work.
