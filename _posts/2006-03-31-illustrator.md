In a nut shell, the Bible says that Job, a man of great wealth, prosperity and faith, was tormented by Satan in a test to see if he would rebuke God. This included the killing of family members, wives, children, animals (lots of animals), burning fields, etc. Think worse case scenario and that’s what Job put through. Despite his torment and torture, Job still gave thanks to God. Satan lost the bet and had to wear a dress for a week (or something like that) while God turned to Job and made sure his life was blessed ten-fold for the remainder of his years.  
 It’s probably a good thing that Adobe Illus’hate’r CS didn’t exist during Bibilical times because I think if Satan had forced Job to use it for just five minutes, that story would have had a different ending.
