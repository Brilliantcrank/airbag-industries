Is it possible that [a lack of good design had something to do with an Internet startup’s failure?](http://www.ryanirelan.com/blog/entry/podtech-sells-for-less-than-500k/)

<div class="quote">[PodTech](http://www.podtech.net/home) Sells for Less Than $500k – They suffered from the same disease a lot of podcasting sites do–not spending a dime on real branding and design. Look at the god awful logo. They raised $7.5 million in funding and that’s the logo? Should’ve spent the money on an identity and branding, not Robert Scoble.</div>That’s [Scoble](http://www.podtech.net/scobleshow), as in Robert Scoble, the guy who once exclaimed that [ugly design (anti-marketing design) is key to Internet fueled success:](http://scobleizer.com/2006/03/04/the-role-of-anti-marketing-design)

<div class="quote">…sites that have ugly designs are well known to pull more revenue, be more sticky, build better brands, and generally be more fun to participate in, than sites with beautiful designs. </div>Kids, next time Uncle Touchy Touchy tells you that bad design equates to big success just remember there are at least seven million reasons why that’s a load of horse pucky.
