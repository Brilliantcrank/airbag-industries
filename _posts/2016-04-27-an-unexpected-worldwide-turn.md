My one year anniversary at [IBM Design](http://ibm.com/design) is on the horizon. Ten months in I have successfully co-created a new program that provides systematic incubation capabilities available to every business unit at company. More importantly, I have, [as Monteiro puts it](https://vimeo.com/143350728#t=14m44s), I “designed” sixty designers. Together we created nine new products and services for a wide array of business domains including global procurement services, cognitive Internet of Things, cognitive education, cloud product support, cloud marketing <span class="caps">SAAS</span>, and Blockchain—patents pending.  

I have learned a lot about myself and where I want to go in my career in the last year. After closing Happy Cog Austin, I was repeatedly asked what I wanted to do, and I didn’t have a good answer at the time. It goes without saying that I wasn’t prepared to go from studio owner one day to unemployed the next.  

Now, after a year of working on the Incubator Program, I know without a doubt that I love leading and mentoring designers—especially the ones right out of school. I have had the privilege of working with world-class talent. But after time, I realized that as much as I enjoyed leading with these teams, I grew weary of having to start over after six-week sprints. It takes a lot of effort, energy, and passion to take a team of strangers and turn them into a highly functional product design team within a few weeks. I enjoyed the challenge, but I got tired of saying goodbye.  

So I have been on a search for a different type of experience. I thought for sure this meant leaving Austin to join a team on the West coast. Many conversations were had, and multiple opportunities were on the horizon, but something seemingly came out of nowhere that I was not expecting.  

A few weeks ago I was invited to join a new team at IBM with a mandate to duplicate the success of the Austin studio around the world (That’s right folks; [Storey Style](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Storey+Style) is going international). While I genuinely want to be reunited with the Pacific Time Zone, this is an opportunity I could not pass up. In this new role, I have the pleasure of working directly with design leaders I admire, and some of you know: [Nigel Prentice](), [Sarah Nelson](https://vimeo.com/76346265), and [Doug Powell](https://twitter.com/douglaspowell1), who has [a new role of his own.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-role-doug-powell?trk=prof-post)  

In my first year at IBM, I proved that I’ve still got it when it comes to leading team’s of designers to fantastic outcomes at a large scale. My attention will now be focused on building a global community for studio directors and design leaders in every continent except that cold one down South.  

West Coast, I will see you soon, but I’ve got a new job to do.
