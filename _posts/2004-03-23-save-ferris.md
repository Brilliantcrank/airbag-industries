[Bob Edwards is being replaced on <span class="caps">NPR</span>‘s Morning Edition](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=495&e=1&u=/ap/npr_edwards), the most popular program on the public radio network, and second only to Rush Limbaugh in nationwide radio syndication.  

This will come completely as a shock to most listeners because Bob has been as much a staple of morning life as is eating breakfast.  

What’s more disturbing is that <span class="caps">NPR</span> seems to have no real reason for firing Edwards.



<div class="quote">Spokeswoman Laura Gross said <span class="caps">NPR</span>‘s programming and news management made the change because they’re trying to refresh all the network’s broadcasts.  

“It’s part of a natural evolution,” she said. “A new host will bring new ideas and perspectives to the show. Bob’s voice will still be heard; he’ll still be a tremendous influence on the show. We just felt it was time for a change.”</div>I’ve always been told, “if it ain’t broken, don’t fix it”. And in this case it’s not only in perfect working order but the most successful radio program produced by National Public Radio. This smells of management misconduct and politics gone bad.  

I’m hoping that grass roots can form and save [Bob’s post at Morning Edition](http://www.npr.org/about/people/bios/bedwards.html). It’s time <span class="caps">NPR</span> felt the power of the blog. Spread the word, write to <span class="caps">NPR</span> management and let them know what a stupid move this is.

Also, I blame Bush. Of course I can’t prove anything yet but I’m sure the Department of Homeland Security is involved on orders from the Whitehouse — black helicopters and all.
