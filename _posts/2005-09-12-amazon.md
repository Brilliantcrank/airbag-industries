If someone would please create an Ajaxy, Web 2.0, Ruby On Rails, Lighttpd based commerce-platform-hooha that would be spiffy. In fact I have no doubt that a parade would be conducted in your honor — or honors if there are more than one of you.  
 I would very much like to have this done posthaste because of all the web application types that are in need of an overhaul, online commerce is way overdue. Everything currently available sucks worse than Wasilla, Alaska.  
 Yeah, it’s *that* bad.  
 Oh and make sure it has a racing stripe down the middle, please.
