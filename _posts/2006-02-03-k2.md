Call me crazy but when 37signals talks about [getting real](http://getreal.37signals.com/) I always assumed they were talking about cutting the red tape, ending bureaucracy, you know that stop making excuses and just do it Web 2.0 machismo.  
 In response to their get real call-to-arms I logged into their new client collaboration environment called [Campfire](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/getting_real_help_us_put_out_the_campfire.php), typed a few messages to some other random people also kicking the tires, posted a file, etc. No big deal.  
 Then I logged out and, I believe, stumbled upon the real meaning of “Getting Real”…

 Hmmm, perhaps the whole mountaineer-just-do-it-theme has always had a deeper, secret meaning.
