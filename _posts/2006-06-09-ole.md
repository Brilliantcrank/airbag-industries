If you can’t get excited watching a World Cup game then I suggest that you immediately go to an emergency room and let them know your heart has stopped beating and your brain is no longer receiving the proper amount of oxygen.  
 I thought I would work from home today while watching the games but minutes after kick-off and it’s hard to focus on anything other than <span class="caps">ESPN2</span>.  
 The [jersey](http://tinyurl.com/jcpdp) is on and I’m drooling over the masterful control these players have of their game.
