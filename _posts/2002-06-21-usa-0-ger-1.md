The earth continues to rotate despite our loss to Germany. What a great tournament it has been for our team, our country! If only more Americans had paid attention.  
 I’m not expert but it looks to me like we played a good game. Every player, on both sides, looks exhausted. We gave them a true run for their money. It was also good to see sportsmanship after the game. No one cried like a baby, nor did they stomp, Mexican style, off the pitch.  
 I am beginning to understand Spanish. A side benefit of watching the World Cup exclusively on Univision.  
 Now I have to focus on staying awake for tonights viewing of Minority Report.  
 Addendum — [Ronald Blum’s story for AP sums up the game perfectly. A must read.](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20020621/ap_on_sp_so_ga_su/soc_wcup_germany_us_29)
