The <span class="caps">NBC</span> Olympics website is growing on me but it still doesn’t stand up to the Studio Archetype creation for the 1998 Nagano games. That website was so expertly done. I used to pour over every page in admiration of the design and architecture. It was a better marriage of sports data and design that has not seen its equal since.  
 Speaking of Olympic design. The Team USA Beret is pretty nifty, but I would rather have something with that cool [Canadian logo](http://204.225.97.122:80/icat/44/19/330344191.fpx?cell=230&cvt=jpeg). Their whole appearance package is very nice. Other team looks that are looking good: Germany, Netherlands, Austria and of course the USA. Who can go wrong with navy blue?  
**<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>** – I realized that unless you were around in 1998 you might not have seen the Nagano Olympics website. Tonight I have added the first feature of Local 415: [1998 Nagano Winter Olympics Website Review](http://www.gregstorey.com/local415/nagano).  
 Have fun.
