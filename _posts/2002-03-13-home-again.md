I am tired. This morning I woke up around 3<span class="caps">AM (PST)</span> in order to make it home but what a great trip I had! SXSW was worth every penny and every hour.  
 Sometime on Monday afternoon, my Powerbook power cord decided to melt. I called Apple and they started to freak out. At one point they almost offered to call paramedics to make sure I was ok. So I just spent 36 hours computer free.  
 Let me tell you something, hotel <span class="caps">TV</span> is not the greatest and they charge $12 a pay-per-view movie these days. That’s almost the price for owning a <span class="caps">DVD</span> movie. I checked out the *OnCommand* system attached to the TV. Its totally hackable but a lack of pliers kept me from phreaking free movies.  
 I have a lot of notes to get online and I’m hoping to get caught up with everything later today. Check out the [Notes Exchange](http://www.sxswblog.com/exchange.asp) on SXSWBlog for a glimpse of what happened in Austin.
