I have much to say about the current events of the last two weeks: the global protests, France and Germany declaring their love for each other, <span class="caps">G.W.</span> preparing for a war without Congress approval, you know those kinds of events.  
 But the history major in me says to do a little more research on this one before I shoot my mouth off again. Lord knows there are thousands of war and anit-war blogs out there. I don’t intend to add to the hysteria.  
 Tonight, <span class="caps">FRONTLINE</span>, the excellent news program on <span class="caps">PBS</span>, will present [*The War Behind Closed Doors*](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/). With all the yammering against or in favor of current US Foreign Policies, I thought it might interest a few of you to watch a little television this evening..  
 The program description, as read from the press release:

> As America teeters on the brink of war with Iraq, <span class="caps">FRONTLINE</span> takes viewers inside the key White House policy battles and discussions that have led the Bush administration to pursue the end of Saddam Hussein’s regime.  
>  In “The War Behind Closed Doors,” airing Thursday, February 20, at 9 P.M. on <span class="caps">PBS</span> ([check local listings](http://tv.yahoo.com/)), <span class="caps">FRONTLINE</span> reveals the internal political machinations and maneuvering that have led the White House to abandon a long-standing policy of “containment” of Iraq in favor of the more aggressive stance of launching preemptive strikes against Iraq–or any nation or group–believed to pose a threat to American security.  
>  Through interviews with key administration officials, policy analysts, and observers, the one-hour documentary also exposes a long-running policy battle between two powerful Washington insiders: Secretary of State Colin Powell and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz.

As with all [<span class="caps">WGBH</span>](http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/) websites, you can expect to see a lot of extra content on their website as soon as the program ends.  
 Until then I recommend two of their subsites from past programs:  
[*The Gulf War*](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/) — “A comprehensive and critical analysis of the 1990-1991 war in which more than one million troops faced off against each other in the deserts of the Gulf states. From the Allied coalition’s air war, to the ground assault, to the liberation of Kuwait, and the fallout of Saddam Hussein’s retaining power, “The Gulf War” deconstructs what really happened, how it happened and why.”  
[*In Search of Al Qaeda*](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/search/) — “What happened to the hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters who survived U.S. airstrikes in the mountains of Afghanistan? <span class="caps">FRONTLINE</span> follows their trail – from the borderlands of Pakistan, across the Gulf of Oman, to Saudi Arabia and Yeman.”
