About an hour ago my site was visited by someone, some persons, hidden behind the <span class="caps">NIPR</span>.mil domain.  

While it’s probably nothing — just some Army Sergeant browsing the web when he/she should be watching for North Korean missile launch detections — it still gives me the creeps.  

It’s like having a ‘pool cleaning company’ van pull up across the street from my house, even though I don’t own a pool.  

So who is the <span class="caps">NIPR</span>? According to the [United States of America Department of Defense Network Information Center](http://www.nic.mil/dodnic/):



> The <span class="caps">NIC</span> is operated by the Defense Information Systems Agency (<span class="caps">DISA</span>). It provides information and services that are mission critical to the operation of the worldwide IP router Defense Information Systems Network and other DoD sponsored networks.  

>  More information about the <span class="caps">NIC</span> and the services it provides is restricted to the .mil community, and those deemed appropriate audiences.



I found more from [While Seated](http://www.whileseated.org/archives/000253.shtml) which quotes:



> <span class="caps">Nipr</span>.mil, as Francisco suspected, is not a single domain a but a hush-hush web proxy that acts as a gateway for hundreds of U.S. military domains in order to hide their identities. It was established by the Defense Information Systems Agency (<span class="caps">DISA</span>) in response to a memorandum (CM-5 1099, <span class="caps">INFOCOM</span>) issued in March 1999 by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, calling for “actions to be taken to increase the readiness posture for Information Warfare.” “Uncontrolled Internet connections,” the document says, “pose a significant and unacceptable threat to all Department of Defense information systems and operations.”



Funny thing is, even with all this big Military Secret Cyber Security 3000, they still use Netscape 3. Maybe they’ll go away if I change my <span class="caps">DOCTYPE</span> to <span class="caps">XHTML</span> Strict.  

More information on our military buddies can be found [here](http://www.bhopal.net/usmilitary.html) and [here](http://www.carnicom.com/nipr.htm). Add others if you find them.
