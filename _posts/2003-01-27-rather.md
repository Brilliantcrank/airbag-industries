I am eagerly waiting the results from yesterdays big game between Budweiser and Pepsi. I heard some initial reports on NPR last Friday but radio has a hard time describing what’s on TV. Still I look forward to seeing the commercials.  
 Instead of planting myself in front of the television for ten hours, the wife and I made way for Disneyland. I had been told by several ‘cast members’ that the slowest day of the year was in January during the big game.  
 I don’t know what they meant by ‘slow’ because half of Southern California was there with all their kids and strollers (Stupid strollers, I hate them so much!). Apparently neither the Raiders or the Buccaneers are special enough to warrant Neilson Ratings in the Los Angeles market, not that Disney minds, they own <span class="caps">ABC</span>.  
 Returning home, I was really surprised to discover that we didn’t attack Iraq. I thought for sure the military would launch a 400 Cruise Missile Salute as part of their Halftime Show routine. Or at least another drone missile attack on a fleeing vehicle somewhere in Yemen.  
 Hey, don’t knock it, even breaking news with Dan Rather would have made better television than just another Britney Spears-<span class="caps">NSYNC</span>-JLo-U2 halftime singspiration and salute to nacho chips.
