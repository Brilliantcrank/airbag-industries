Alright, I’m done bashing Apple, Macintosh and Steve Jobs.  

Not because I still own one of the first <span class="caps">B&W</span> G3’s to hit Alaska. Nor because I also have easy access – like right across the home office – to a spiffy new Powerbook G4. Or because I have visited the new iMacs at work at least three times because I think they are so damn cool.  

The Airbag Anti-Apple, Think Greed, Campaign will stop if only because that’s what [Dan](http://www.hivelogic.com) wants.
