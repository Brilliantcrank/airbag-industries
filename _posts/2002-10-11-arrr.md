As many of you know, Former President Carter was awarded the [Noble Peace Prize](http://www.nobel.se/peace/index.html) today for his ground breaking work on the 1978 Camp David Peace Accords and outstanding commitment to improving human rights and living conditions.  
 Congratulations Jimmy!  
 In related news, Airbag was selected as [Pixellated’s Site Pix](http://www.pixellated.org/) for October.  
 Mr. Carter is off to Jamaica to make sure their elections are kosher — Iâ€™m on my way to the Pirates of the Caribbean where dead men tell no tales.
