I grow tired of designing websites.  
 I want to start designing real communities, new living spaces, and urban culture. I’m not talking about designing the next mini-mall, crap on that! I’m looking at how new designers are using recycled materials, new lighting technology, and cultural theory to create new communities that are smart, unique, and life enhancing.  
 Unless we are to live our lives within a computer, the design of the space around us is just as important (if not more important) as the online spaces we use to pay bills or to check email.  
 Recently I have become more excited about the pursuit of knowledge in this new era of design and today I bring you a short list of resources to learn more about this yourself.  
[Metropolis](http://www.metropolismag.com) is a monthly pleasure cruise through the tangible world of architecture and cultural design. It makes architects read like rock stars. I just ordered their new compilation book, *Design Is…* featuring comments, designs, photos, and commentary from todays leading edge designers and architects.  
[Frame](http://www.framemag.com) goes mostly inside to speak about interior spaces and how to make them hip and liveable. Articles about light casting appear next to a feature about a German store that uses recycled cardboard for walls. The actual magazine is thick with a heavy cover that invites the reader to keep each issue for a long time.  
[Dwell](http://www.dwellmag.com) magazine triggers something in my mind that makes me want to pack it all up and move deep inside a city. Dwell is not all about neo-Urban living but it does feature the most attractive cultural design projects and from all over the world.  
[Design Boom](http://www.designboom.com/eng), from Milan, Italy, is a web site that I stumbled upon by accident but stayed long enough to enjoy. It’s actually the site for a design business that creates new media projects for manufacturers, fashion, and designers. The online magazine features pieces about all forms of design. Unfortunately I don’t think this ever sees the light of print so the digital format will have to do.  
[Congress of New Urbanism](http://cnu.org) is a revolution for smarter urbanism. The CNU seeks to design and engineer better urban spaces in order to attract more people away from the idea of vastly sprawling suburbs. Their new book, *Charter of The New Urbanism* was welcomed into the Airbag library recently.  
[This Old House](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/thisoldhouse/) is like a grandfather to urban design but I believe a leader of the practice of redefining the use of existing spaces. They constantly rebuild old, historically significant, and protected homes into superb living quarters for the modern family.  
 Keep in mind that these are links to online versions of the real thing and I highly recommend viewing each resource in it’s original form.
