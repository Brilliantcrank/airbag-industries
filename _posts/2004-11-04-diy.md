The Associated Free Press is reporting that [Bush is remodeling his kitchen](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/afp/20041104/pl_afp/us_vote&cid=1521&ncid=2043), starting with the cabinets. On the list of things to replace: John Ashcroft, Colin Powell, Donald Rhumsfeld, and Tom Ridge.  
 I feel bad for Colin, being made to make a jerk of himself in front of the world. Of all the men currently serving the Whitehouse, he is the one I would rather see as President. I’d vote for him without blinking an eye. He’s presidential material and I hope we will see more of him, though as a presidential candidate and nothing less.  
 Tom, John, and Donald, adios amigos. Don’t let the beltway hit your ass on the way out suckas.  
 I think the next four years are going to be easier to predict when we see the replacements — maybe Rudy or McCain?
