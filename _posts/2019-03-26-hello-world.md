<p class="intro">Welcome to the typography page for Jekyll Boilerplate. I'm glad you are interested in using this and want to show you how elements look.</p>

<p><strong>This is what blockquotes look like.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an example of a post containing HTML. You can have as many of these as you like, but if you get too many it might be easier to put them in a <code>_pages</code> directory. It'll help keep your root directory clear. Don't forget to add an includes for the <code>_pages</code> directory to your <code>_config.yml</code> file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Perhaps you'd like to see what an unordered list looks like?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Unordered list item #1</li>
  <li>Unordered list item #2</li>
  <li>Unordered list item #3</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Or you'd prefer to see what an ordered list looks like?</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Ordered list item #1</li>
  <li>Ordered list item #2</li>
  <li>Ordered list item #3</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>This is what the headings look like.</strong></p>

<h1>Headline 1</h1>

<h2>Headline 2</h2>

<h3>Headline 3</h3>

<h4>Headline 4</h4>

<h5>Headline 5</h5>

<h6>Headline 6</h6>

<hr>

<p>Colors and fonts are kept in variables to make things easy to change. Check the head of the <code>/assets/css/style.css</code> file for more detail.</p>
