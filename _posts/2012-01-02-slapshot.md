In case you missed it, [we are looking for a Sr. <span class="caps">UX</span> Designer to join the ](http://www.authenticjobs.com/jobs/10992/senior-user-experience-designer) [Happy Cog](http://www.happycog.com) team in Austin, Texas. I’m going to give the application receiving phase till the end of this week. To date I’ve received a handful of really excellent applications and I’m anxious to see what turns up “last minute.” The team and I are looking forward to finding a good compliment to our well-established group.  
 A personal thought about this position. The <span class="caps">UX</span> community seems to put an unnecessarily strong emphasis on quantity as it pertains to conferences and public speaking. At Happy Cog we like to see members of our team speak and teach others but we’re looking for a designer, not a public speaker. I’m looking for someone who is more interested in creating solutions instead of delivering slide shows on stage. If you desire to work with a highly skilled, highly talented team that loves nothing more than an elegant, well crafted solution then please send me your resume, references and salary history.  
 Meanwhile, over at [Authentic Jobs](http://www.authenticjobs.com/) they are kicking off the New Year right with a special on job listings for the first half of January.

 One last related thought in effort to score a Jobs Post Hat Trick. In case you missed it, [Cameron posted a nice teaser for Authentic Crew](http://authenticjobs.tumblr.com/post/15187745938/crewing), a service/application that has been in the works for a while. I have a lot of passion for this addition to the Authentic suite and I’m ecstatic to finally see it start to come alive. Crew is going to be a big asset to everyone’s career path.
