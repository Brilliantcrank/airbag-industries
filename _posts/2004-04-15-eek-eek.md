[The infinite monkey theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) suggests that if one million monkeys type keys at random eventually such a monkey would recreate every book in Franceâ€™s National Library.  
 This would explain a lot about the French, but I digress.  
 So what would we get if we switch monkeys for President Bush, or Jessica Simpson, or the Iraqi Information Minister?  
 Also, [listen to this](http://www.airbag.ca/bucket/nevertrustamonkey.mp3). I promise it will make your day.
