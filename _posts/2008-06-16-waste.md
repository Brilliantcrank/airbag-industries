I can’t believe this made the news. Gore endorses Obama? [What a load of crap](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/us/politics/17campaign.html?hp):

> Former Vice President Al Gore made his debut appearance in the presidential campaign here Monday evening, offering a vigorous endorsement of Senator Barack Obama and urging Democrats to keep in mind the consequences of not taking the general election with grave seriousness.

Wow, that took a lot courage—come out after it’s clear Obama won the nomination and then throw support behind his candidacy. I appreciate that Al may have his head elsewhere (no comment) but given his prominence in our political system and in the Democrat Party, I expected way, way more from him and he failed to deliver, once again.  

If this is to be the way Old America choses to run things at the <span class="caps">DNC</span> then they may as well crown McBush president and save this country the huge cost of running a federal election.
