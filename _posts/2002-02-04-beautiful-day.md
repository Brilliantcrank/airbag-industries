Yesterdays football game may have been okay but the live U2 miniconcert was awesome. And thank the Lord for the miracle of the Internet, the people at [U2 Out Load](http://www.u2outloud.com/) have already have it recorded and available in <span class="caps"> MP3</span> format.  
 Did you like the free concert? Was it better than last years Britney Spears tubesock armband dance review?
