[Mike](http://www.screenflicker.com/blog/) has thrown the meme baton at me, ouch.  
**Total volume of music files on my computer:** 19.64 <span class="caps">GB</span>

[“Phantom Theory”](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007KK7J/airbag-20/) by Futureshock, which is close to becoming seriously out of print. A kind lady at the Virgin Mega Store in Times Square sold it to me for 24% of the import sticker price.
