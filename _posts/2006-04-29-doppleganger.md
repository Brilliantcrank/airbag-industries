I’ve never understood why some people chose to leave comments anonymously (meaning they use a false name, email address and/or web address).  
 It’s not like anyone has been killed or was violently beaten because of a comment they left on a blog. Names are called and words are thrown around like rocks but I don’t get why some feel the need to hide behind false information. It’s annoying.  
 But what really pisses me off to no end is when someone choses to leave a comment using someone else’s identity. Especially if that identity belongs to be a friend. That’s exactly what someone in Burnaby, British Columbia did yesterday when they left a comment posing as [Dave Shea](http://www.mezzoblue.com).  
 When I first saw the comment it didn’t sit well because knowing Dave as I do it was the type of message he would have said using back channels. More importantly I had a hard time thinking of how Dave could post a comment from within western Canada when he was in deep in the heart of Reykjavik, Iceland.  
 I’m not amused. Neither is Dave.  
 So to the person using <span class="caps">IP</span> address 206.116.180.35 I have to ask how weak are you? If you can muster up the courage to own your words then come back and leave a proper comment with your own damn identity.
