Yesterday afternoon I received an email from Shawn O’Keefe, the Web Awards Coordinator for <span class="caps">SXSW</span> Interactive —

> Dear Greg Storey,  
>  Congratulations!  
>  “Airbag” has been selected as a finalist for the [2003 <span class="caps">SXSW</span> Interactive Festival Website Competition](http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/web_awards/finalists/) in the “Weblog” category! We received so many amazing entries this year, so being selected to the finalist round is a significant honor.

Bloggies be damned.  
 The competition is stacked against [an entire community of Josh (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Whedon fans](http://whedonesque.com/), [a designer from <span class="caps">IDEO</span>](http://www.erichian.com/) who has some incredible shots of the Czech Republic and super <span class="caps">DJ</span> mixes, [Griff of Ultramicroscopic fame](http://www.ultramicroscopic.com/) who lurks around here from time to time, and finally [a photoblogger from Houston Texas](http://www.pixelog.org/) who has traveled to some great places and has nice photos to prove it!  
 Wow!  
 As much as I would have preferred to take on the *Iron Chef* with a ferocious calamari and pumpkin squash recipe, being a part of this competition is just too damn cool.  
 For all the new people just arriving, hello and welcome. This is Airbag and it will require a sense of humor, a few grains of salt, and an opinion of your own. Comment frequently and link regularly to get the full effect.
