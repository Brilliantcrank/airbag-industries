After reading Larry Bodine’s “Macintosh ate my children, solicited underaged Congressional pages for pictures, and tested nukes in North Korea” [story](http://wilshipley.com/blog/2006/10/flame-my-birthday-present-to-me.html) I could empathize.  
 You see I was suckered into thinking that buying a Chevrolet truck would make me a better American, a better man. I took “like a rock” to mean that I would get a patriotic workout while driving across the golden plains of this country and wearing a construction helmet. Instead I’m left stuck in traffic jams with a gas guzzling, underpowered, limp product created in every country but America and I’m still bent towards Canadian ideology.
