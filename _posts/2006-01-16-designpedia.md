I received an email this morning from a friend doing research. He asked, “what are the design related sites that you look at every day, and If you had to pick one which is the best?”  

Going through my pile of links crammed under the topics of “Daily” and “Design” there are several sites that discuss design in one way or another but few are devoted primarily to the practice, vocation, and art of design.  

Here’s the short list of design specific sites that I visit frequently.



<div class="block">[Core77](http://www.core77.com/)  

[Design Boom](http://www.designboom.com/eng/)  

[Design Interact](http://www.designinteract.com/)  

[Design Observer](http://www.designobserver.com/)  

[Net Diver](http://www.netdiver.net)</div>If I had to chose just one it would be Core77 because I like the variety of design topics rather than focusing on just one vocation.  

Now It’s your turn. What are the design related sites that you look at every day? And If you had to pick one which is the best?  

And please, please good people, the Airbag can only take so many hastily, cut-and-pasted <span class="caps">URL</span>s in the comment box. I implore you to make proper links so as to make this entry a nice little resource for everyone while providing easy-to-use responses for those doing said research — don’t forget to explain what site is your absolute favorite and why, it’s important.
