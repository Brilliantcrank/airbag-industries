There have been quite a few times when, sitting in front of the flatpanel, I wonder what life would be like if I was doing something else that had nothing to do with the Internet.  
 Maybe there is bliss in being a gardener or a carpenter. Or a zookeeper. I could be the guy who preps the food for the Panda bears. Hell some afternoons I would settle for a nice cushy job as Postmaster for 92780. All I need to qualify is a membership with the NRA.  
**[Then a job like this comes around](http://jobsearch.monster.com/getjob.asp?JobID=17410914&AVSDM=2003%2D03%2D14+11%3A59%3A00%2E000&CCD=my%2Emonster%2Ecom&JSD=jobsearch%2Emonster%2Ecom&HD=company%2Emonster%2Ecom&AD=http%3A%2F%2Fjobsearch%2Emonster%2Ecom%2Fjobsearch%2Easp%3Fq%3DMarvel%2BComics%26sort%3Drv%26vw%3Db%26cy%3DUS%26brd%3D1%252C1862%252C1863&Logo=1&col=dltci&cy=US&brd=1%2C1862%2C1863&lid=&fn=&q=Marvel+Comics)** and then I think to myself â€” New York City, why are you so far away?
