I’m about to get on the 5 and head home but before I do please note that I had to completely resurrect Airbag this morning from an old template backup and yesterdays entry export. I’m not sure what, if anything, is broken or looks out of place.  

This is why all the comments from the last post all seem to have happened within minutes of each other. And I have no idea what this has done for <span class="caps">RSS</span> readers.  

Once I am settled I will recount the story of how Airbag was nearly lost forever. Until then I will leave you with this quote from Shelly, a support person at [Moveable Type](http://www.movabletype.org).

> The delete weblog issue is believed to be a bug with [MT Blacklist](http://www.movabletype.org/developers_contest_plugin_pack_2004.shtml).

Whoops. That information would have been handy to have twenty-four hours ago.
