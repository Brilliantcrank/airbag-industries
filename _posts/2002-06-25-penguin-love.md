Calling all tech-dorks and comp-nerds (hey, I’m looking in the mirror here so don’t get all offended).  

I need your help.  

At work we are going to be revamping everything. Email servers, web servers, databases (well that’s going to be Microsoft SQL), etc.  

My new boss is looking at using a Microsoft stack to tackle all of our needs but I think he needs a good look at Open Source alternatives. The problem is I don’t know enough beyond, “hey lets use Linux!”  

He’s going on vacation and it would be a wonderful thing to send him off with some printed articles, books, etc. that will help him visualize how we can use community supported solutions to all of our IT problems.  

Let the linking and suggesting commence. Any and all help is appreciated.
