My frustrations with Google never cease.  
 A while ago I was denied participation in their text based advertising program that has become a common element of personal sites everywhere. Somehow Airbag (this site) was way more personal than other sites that display pictures of cats or posts about breakfast cereal. I merely wanted to make a mockery of the whole shebang and perhaps the could see right through my honest looking application.  
 Whatever, I can deal with that.  
 Now they have removed my site from [search results for the word ‘Airbag’](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=airbag). Up until now this site was the number one search result; ahead of the National Safety Council Air Bag & Seat Belt Safety Campaign, way ahead of Airbag – Supplementa Restraint Systems or even Airbag Craftworks (which make some pretty cool bags).  
 This independent periodical is no where to be found in Google’s search results for the word Airbag – despite that it held at number one for more than a year.  
 You can’t give me crap about this site having nothing to do with vehicle safety because the number three slot is currently held by a German handbag company. And I have written extensively about safety issues with buying [used airbags](http://www.gregstorey.com/airbag/archives/000119.shtml).  
 What’s the point in creating a personal site if people can’t find it by searching under the title?  
 I can’t believe that Google, the parent company of [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com), would go to efforts to exclude personal sites, much less a blog from their results yet this appears to be the case.  
 Stupid, stupid search engine — who’s logo, by the way, sucks. Bigtime.
