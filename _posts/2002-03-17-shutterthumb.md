On April 15th, 2001, I received a Canon Supershot digital camera for my 30th birthday. It was a gift with a subliminal message: *you’re old because you remember having a Kodak Disc Camera*. Remember the Disc? It was a total 80’s device with the advert jingle: “I’m gonna get you with the Kodak Disc, and sure as shootin I’m not gonna miss, not when it’s easy, easy as this, I’m gonna get ya with the Kodak Disc.”  
 Having a digital camera is cool. Mostly because you don’t have to pay someone to develop your images. Nor do you have to wait for some Fuji Jockey to over develop, poorly crop, or just plain loose your photos. With a USB connection its all plug and play in the very same minute on the very same day (That one’s for you Kristian).  
 I don’t like a lot of photos of people. Mostly because I hate having my own picture taken but also because I admire photographers like Ken Duncan. He takes these incredible landscape photos that really give you the feeling of being there. That’s what I want to do when I grow up.  
 Back in November 2001, my wife and I took a trip with friends to New York City. I was really looking forward to it because not many people from where I was raised make it that far. I would see my long time friend Mitch (also a former Alaskan), walk through Central Park, gasp at Ground Zero, and wave to the Statue of Liberty. It was a remarkable trip and I can’t wait to get back.  
 This morning I have put some final touches on my photo gallery, [Shutterthumb * No Film Display](http://www.gregstorey.com/shutterthumb), and hope that you will take a look at my attempt to put you inside New York, New York. Some of my favorites pictures are found on the right side of this site. Others include wide shots of [Central Park](http://www.gregstorey.com/shutterthumb/archives/000049.html), [Times Square](http://www.gregstorey.com/shutterthumb/archives/000087.html), and looking out toward [Harlem](http://www.gregstorey.com/shutterthumb/archives/000024.html).
