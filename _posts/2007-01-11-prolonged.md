Since when did it become evil-chaotic to design a website taller than the browser window thereby forcing a user to scroll-down? More and more I’m seeing feedback, reactions, and responses to designers work in which that particular problem is being called out (For example: “it’s good but you really ought to make it so that the user doesn’t have to scroll”).  

Come again?  

I agree that forcing a user to click down through six feet of webpagery isn’t advisable but where did this new anti-scroll-wheel ideology come from? I’m not a usability expert—I leave that mythical practice to scientists—but I’ve done enough Don’t Make Me Think style testing to know that scrolling, like clicking, is an essential part of the web user interface and a commonly accepted one. Perhaps I missed that issue of Digital Web (I kid, I kid!) but scrolling isn’t bad. Poor design that forces a person to scroll for a few seconds before seeing any content (hello, Geocities?!) is bad but we can’t Sadam the mouse for that.  

Meanwhile, am I the only one who thinks Apple’s new phone thing is cool but not the end of the world? All it means is that no one will ever, truly, really, leave work at the office. Bleh. I’d rather have a secretary.  

And also, I appreciate your patience with my little private war with the Longboard del.icio.us insurgency but not to worry, I’m going to throw humans at the problem.
