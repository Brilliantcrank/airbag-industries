If there is any doubt that our society is ‘at war’ then take a [look at today’s cover](http://www.gregstorey.com/airbag/images/msnbc_july4.jpg) from <span class="caps">MSNBC</span>. The only thing missing is an appeal for young men to join the Army and something about rationing food.  
 Today I will ‘go fourth’ and not be hindered by terror. Nor by the idiots who are packing the highways and airports in order to get a glimpse of real freedom, the kind that doesn’t bind you to a 9 to 5.  
 I’m going to fight terror by eating my breakfast as I would normally do each weekday morning. Hell, I might even give Osama the bird and travel to Starbucks and order me an iced liberty latte.  
 Happy 4th everyone — let’s roll.
