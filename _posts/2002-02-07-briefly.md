1.  [Windows XP Professional ](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/default.asp) has amazed me. Installed it on a Pentium II MMX 233 MHz and damn if it’s not 10 times faster. Its very nice but [Macintosh v.X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) still has my heart.



2.  If you’re not reading [Captain Marvel](http://www.x-men.com/comics/bios/bio_captainmarvel3.htm), then you’re missing the [Starman](http://members.aol.com/nachro2/starmenu.htm) of the [Marvel Universe](http://www.marvel.com/). This is my first Peter David comic and it’s worth every penny. Highly recommended!



3.  The new Chemical Brothers <span class="caps">CD</span>, [Come with Us](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005U1YO/qid=1013122463/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-6254297-5204649) is a lot of fun and I have been listening to it every day for the last two weeks. By the way, it’s time to show your support and pledge to <span class="caps">[KCRW](http://www.kcrw.org)</span>, the coolest <span class="caps">NPR</span> station in the United States.



4.  I’m going to <span class="caps">[SXSW](http://www.sxsw.com)</span> in March and wanted to take the train but alas I think its the jet age for me. I wanted to try a different method of transportation but [Amtrak](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36239-2002Feb6.html) will have to wait.



5.  Been addicted to [Quake III Arena](http://www.planetquake.com/quake3/) lately. Nothing beats a good game of multiplayer capture the flag. I’m looking forward to playing [Return to Castle Wolfenstien](http://www.apple.com/games/articles/2002/02/wolfenstein/).
