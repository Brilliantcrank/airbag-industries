It’s green for go time. In less than 24 hours the United States will defeat Germany and advance to the World Cup semi-finals. I know it to be, our time has come.  
 For those, and there are many of you, who would shrug off the foreseen victory against our European allies I say bull-pucky.  
 Our squad has [beaten the Germans twice](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/germany_v_usa/newsid_2054000/2054949.stm) in their last four matches. And need I remind anyone that Brad Friedel, our goalie, is [currently ranked number one](http://worldcup.espnsoccernet.com/statistics?lang=us) in this tournament.  
 We have huge motivation to win. Our team is playing the Cup of their lives and will be running at 110%, full adrenaline, during the ninety minutes of play.  
 Regardless of the outcome all must watch the match and cheer for the home team.  
 Our win over Germany begins Friday morning at 7:30<span class="caps">AM EST</span>. Don’t be late.
