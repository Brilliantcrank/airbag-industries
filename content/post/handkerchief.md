I can’t think of a Fall retail season that’s been so rough on gamers. As it is the season that buts up against the spending/buying tsunami known as Christmas (Jesus who?) a lot of games are released during this time. That’s to be expected but this <span class="caps">XRS</span> is proving to be extremely difficult as I barely have time to game as it is (not a bad thing necessarily) and yet there are a lot of titles being released that I have been tracking—waiting/wanting to play—for a long, long time.



> - Halo 3

> - Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfrare

> - Mass Effect

> - Assassin’s Creed

> - Medal of Honor Airborne

> - The Orange Box

> - Enemy Territory: Quake Wars

> - Hellgate: London

> - Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron

> - Warhawk

> - Folklore

> - Unreal Tournament III

> - Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction

> - Super Mario Galaxy

> - The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass

> - Harvey Birdman



Some of these plastic tools of wonderment have already been obtained and played (Halo 3 has been conquered though that was hardly a battle worthy of song) but to get through the rest of the list I’m going to need the power of Santa, Fred Thompson, and American Express to help decide which lucky titles will make it into the library.  

At least Blizzard isn’t releasing anything this year.
