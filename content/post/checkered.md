The new employee (can you still call employees employee now? Seems that most places use designations like “team member”, “associate”, or “expert” these days) has made the case for a post of equal opportunity for Nintendo DS gamers. Besides, there are way more people playing Nintendo <span class="caps">DS</span> than any <span class="caps">PC</span> based game, <span class="caps">MMO</span> or not.  

So lets have it. Post your Nintendo <span class="caps">WiFi</span> Friend Code and list of current compatible games (which absolutely must include Super Mario Kart).  

And then sometime in August there will be an announcement for the inaugural Airbag Grand Prix.
