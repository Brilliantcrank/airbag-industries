<span class="caps">**FIGURE 1.** NOT SURE WHAT THIS MEANS BUT IT HURTS MY HEAD.</span>  

My wife is the smartest, most intelligent person I know. And I want that to be understood around here.  

While she was away, I snuck a photo of something she was working on for class. I say something because I have no idea what I’m looking at. I don’t know if it’s a cure of cancer or simply a way to levitate cars <span class="caps">ALA</span> Jetsons, but damn if the Rocket Scientist is not of this world. Or at least not of my world.  

Thank God for design. Otherwise I’d just be the janitor who cleans the white-boards when the rocket scientist is through with them. Albeit a damn witty janitor.
