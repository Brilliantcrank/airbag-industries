On the topic of Marvel Comics [creating the first openly gay comic book character](http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/12/09/rawhide.kid.gay/index.html), let’s set the record straight.  

<span class="caps">D.C.</span> Comics, that other comic book company from New York, created the first comic featuring an openly gay super—spy named [Codename: Knockout](http://www.dccomics.com/directcurrents/comics/dec_02/dec_02display.html?index=16), which happens to be on it’s nineteenth issue.  

The [Kryptonite category](http://www.gregstorey.com/airbag/archives/cat_kryptonite) finally fulfills it’s mission and purpose in life.
