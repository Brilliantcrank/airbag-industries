[![](http://www.airbagindustries.com/images/help_88x31.gif)](http://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/ts/my-pay-page/PX3BEL97U9A4I) Russ, who is a friend and great former boss, [made a comment tonight](http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/006837.php#15539) that is likely to get buried in the other responses of my previous post. After reading it I felt like what he said deserved better exposure.

News agencies are beginning to report [the death toll could reach 300,000 people](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=9005729) unless supplies, services and clean water reach the huge area affected (which I believe to be roughly the area of the west and east coast of America combined). Clearly this disaster is a long way from being over.  
While our governments may not make good on their promises, we can. In every way you and I are better people than most of our politicians and helping in this disaster is one way to demonstrate that. Don’t stop writing about the disaster and need for support until it’s over.  

And when we have all done our very best to help those affected I’ll tell you the story of how a father had his butt handed to him, by his young son, in a game of no limit Texas Hold’em.
