While 99% of the blogeratti has just tattooed *Powerbook Lust* across their chest there are a few who are not so easily swayed by Apple lust and religious fervor. Here are two of my favorites (be sure to click the links to continue reading).  

[Thomas nails it, bull’s-eye, flawless victory:](http://jogin.com/blog/archives/000186.php) “Hi, I’m Steve Jobs. Welcome everybody, to the San Francisco Macworld 2003 Keynote. Boy, do we have some cool stuff to show you todaaaay…”  

But first, let me just repeat everything I said last year. There’s super-cool iTools, and, there’s the Switch ads, and, all the other stuff I told you about last year, too.”  

[Jon’s puzzled by the overwhelming blind reaction:](http://www.jonwiggens.com/MT/archives/000197.html#000197) “I’m all for new Apple products and the excitement that surrounds them around every Macworld event. However, I’m finding all the hype getting a little stale. I’ve talked to people that are already touting Safari to be the best browser they’ve ever used. Give me a break.”  

I’ll add that Apple produces some really nice work, but I grow very more tired of Jobs and 1 Infinity Loop. It used to be that owning a Macintosh was something unique but now it seems the Church of 1 Infinite Loop keeps doubling it’s congregation each year.  

Who let these people in anyway? I mean is it just me or did Apple fever start growing worse since the iMac/iBook was introduced?
