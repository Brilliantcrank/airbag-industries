In the last week I have somehow received the blessing and the curse that is free cable television. I think it has something to do with the new cable modem but who really cares — I have free cable!  

There’s the Cartoon Network, History Channel, Sci-Fi, Weather Channel, <span class="caps">MSNBC, CNBC, CNN , MTV, VH1</span> and the ever popular <span class="caps">FOX</span> News with their exclusive live coverage of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  

It has been a long while since I’ve had access to this many television stations. Now I can see why other bloggers churn out posts with topics ranging from contact forms to a picture of a rodent.  

I mean, who has time to write anything spectacular when the History Channel is piping in archive footage of World War II 24/7? And holy crap, has anyone else noticed how many programs they have on the history of the Hindenburg?  

It’s enough to make a grown man cry.
