It would appear that after changing the meta information (keywords that describe this site to search engines) Airbag is back on top, where it has been for a long time.  

Go figure.  

I understand the plight of Google needing to make the search results relevant to what the user may be looking for. But instead of searching for an airbag why can’t a person search for the title airbag?  

Why don’t search engines provide a way to [search by title, author, or subject?](http://www.gregstorey.com/airbag/aft/googlebysubject.gif)  

Maybe I missed something, fell off the Google truck the day they unveiled this new feature, but I don’t even see options for this in the Advanced Search mode.  

I can go to a library or Barnes & Noble and find books or magazines by any of these criteria, so why can’t I search the web the same way?
