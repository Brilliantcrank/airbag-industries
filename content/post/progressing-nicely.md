**All skate, all skate**  

After considering the recent feedback, I have opened an archive. While functional I’m not completely happy with how it turned out. I want to replace the Worth Reading and Best Sellers sections with dynamic MT code that will output what are the most popular and frequently linked too. I wasn’t too big on carrying about archives on the old site but I am now seeing some potential for the feature.  

I’d also like to turn on the MT Search box, but I need to read more on how to style the search results listings.  

**Longboard <span class="caps">RSS</span> Feeds**  

I believe I have found why titles don’t show up for longboard entries in feed readers. None of the Longboard entries have titles. Everything is stored in the entry field. This wasn’t a problem for the old Airbag website, from where the <span class="caps">XML</span> template was copied. So I’m left to assume that it has something to do with the way Moveabletype is set up.  

**Still on the to do list**  

Site validation, IE5/Mac, more graphic elements, and a new category. Oh and I’d like to get back to practicing English.
