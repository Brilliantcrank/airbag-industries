For those who do not know me, I collect comic books. Have since 1987. Every Wednesday new shipments arrive, thus the name of this category, *Kryptonite Wednesday*. Because fantastic stories with incredible art and color (yeah I like the black & white stuff too) is to damn hard to keep away from.  

Here’s my shopping list for tomorrow:

- <span class="caps">DC COMICS</span>  
- Batman Gotham Knights #26  
- Birds of Prey #40  
- Haven the Broken City #3  
- Robin #99  
- span class="caps">MARVEL</span>  
- Exiles #10  
- Thunderbolts #61
