Accessibility is important — right up there next the regular intake of oxygen. So when I came across this piece on [“Unlabelled search fields”](https://adactio.com/journal/10910) by Mr. Keith, I had to help spread the word.

> [_Adam Silver_](http://adamsilver.io/) _is writing a book on forms — you may be familiar with his previous book on_ [_maintainable CSS_](http://maintainablecss.com/)_. In a recent article (that for some reason isn’t on his blog), he looks at markup patterns for search forms and advocates that we should_ [_always use a label_](https://medium.com/simple-human/always-use-a-label-a39ceab554e6)_. I agree. But for some reason, we keep getting handed designs that show unlabelled search forms. And no, a placeholder is not a label._

Jeremy then goes through several examples of how design teams around the world are working through this problem. I don’t want to spoil the conclusion, but safe-to-say, if you make digital things, you need to read this piece and share it out to your own network.
