[Podcasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast), people. I want to know what podcast, blogcasts, whatevercast you are listening too and why.  

Later today I have a long flight across the contiguous 48 states without the benefit of DirectTV <span class="caps">ALA</span> JetBlue — stupid, no-DirectTV, Continental Airlines — so I need some content to listen too.  

I’ve found a few good subscriptions through the normal channels: [<span class="caps">NPR</span>](http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_directory.php) and [<span class="caps">KCRW</span>](http://www.kcrw.org/podcast/), and thankfully happened upon [Digg Nation](http://revision3.com/diggnation) about a month ago.  

Now I want to find more good quality programs but as I’m new to this I thought I would ask around to see what’s good and not necessarily what’s popular or in with the Adam ‘Podfather’ Curry crowd.  

So, back to my original question: What podcasts are you listening too and why?
