I don’t know about you but I was looking forward to seeing what an Apple designed special U2 iPod would look like. The marriage of these two mega brands and creative power houses should have produced something leaving the masses drooling and wanting. An atomic explosion of design and substance.  

Instead the [U2 iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/u2/) looks like the [A-Team van](http://images.google.com/images?q=A-Team+van&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search).  

What the hell is that all about? They could have at least put an anti-war message on the damn thing — though I would have preferred an Anarchy button in place of rewind.  

And speaking of navigating songs, I thought it would be a good idea to give pop stars an iPod of their own. You know, it’s so difficult being a star, you hardly have enough time to think, let alone learn how to use something so complex as an iPod. Why it’s no wonder Ashlee Simpson found herself dancing to the sound of her own voice on live television.  

If only an iPod existed that would make lip syncing fool proof so we wouldn’t have to know that our musicians only pretend to sing live. And then we could go on with our lives without having to worry wether or not the person performing on television was lip syncing or not.  

[That’s why I came up with the iPod Ashlee Simpson Karaoke Edition.](https://www.airbagindustries.com/bucket/ipod/)
