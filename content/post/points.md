Growing up in Alaska was not the most multicultural experience a person can have but I can tell you this, everyone I knew (White, Black, whatever) would have been offended if anyone suggested that they needed ‘extra points’ based on their skin color to be successful in life.  

It’s downright stupid, damn wrong, to think that we need to classify people as being a minority or a majority and then create some kind of reward system based on this classification. This isn’t a solution to America’s race problem, it’s the basis for credit card frequent flyer miles programs.  

The University of Michigan (and anybody who believes skin rewards is okay) needs to wake up and start treating everyone with the same dignity and respect — easily done once they remove their head from their ass.
