After reading [today’s New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/29/international/middleeast/29search.html) I had a vision of what television will be like in 2013:



<div class="block">In 2004, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn’t commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire — the I-Team.</div>I’m sure it will be like the original but this time in high-definition or hologram, where available.  

<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: It appears the I-Team already exists (who knew?) and [they have caught the <span class="caps">TSA</span> making illegal strip searches in Reagan National Aiport](http://www.wjla.com/news/stories/1104/190100.html). No mention of what biscuit recipe and duct tape combination the I-Team used to defeat the bad guys.
