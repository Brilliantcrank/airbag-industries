Another week of random thoughts. I hope you're sleeping better than I am.

* I don’t know what’s in the water lately, but I’m on a tear to read, write, design, synthesize ideate. I haven’t felt this creative or the need to get so much done in a very long time. There are not enough hours in the day, but thankfully we’re on the right side of the winter solstice, which means there are more hours in the day where I don’t feel completely drained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
* Side note: I might be to solar-powered to live in the PNW full time. If we're here for good, I'm going to need a retreat in California.
* The book shipped. It’s called [Remote Work for Design Teams.](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/facilitating-remote-workshops/ "Remote Work for Design Teams") I wrote the bulk of content directed towards design leaders. I’m proud of this work and the work of my co-authors. Also, the incredible village it took to make it all happen from the idea to published book in two weeks. Last Friday, we celebrated with a virtual happy hour, and I think all told around forty folks showed up at some point. Just to give you an idea of how many people were behind the entire effort. Thankfully I have more writing to do. Same audience, but content geared for an entirely different discussion. More on this later. Meanwhile, my article on [facilitating remote workshops](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/facilitating-remote-workshops/ "facilitating remote workshops") hit the Internet this week, and it’s getting a lot of positive attention.
* Why did Apple force hyperlinks in Notes to appear in yellow on a white background? This can’t be accessible, but it’s certainly a horrible user experience. Who makes these kinds of brain-fart decisions at a company acknowledged by the world as the leader in extraordinary design? Whoever the jerk is, they should be fired immediately.
* I have been doing more thinking on the future of this website, but more importantly, the brand. It’s too damn cool—if you don’t mind me saying—for a blog. I’ve been talking to Dorny about how to do something bigger with more folks involved. I’ve got some ideas percolating, especially one that would be crazy if it could be pulled off.
* Remember, [Volume One by Matt Owen](https://vimeo.com/396325107 "Volume One by Matt Owen")? Damn, that was one cool website.
* Another throwback, how about Veer. I recently discovered that you can [download PDFs](http://web.archive.org/web/20070223092525/http://www.veer.com/ideas/catalogs/ "download the old catalogs") of almost all of their old catalogs for which they won several awards for their design.
* Speaking of dope purveyors of amazing typefaces, check out [Janus](https://threedotstype.com/product/janus/ "Janus") by ThreeDotsType.
* I did the thing I posted about on Twitter and bought two sports video games, NBA2K20 and FIFA20. I didn’t buy them to play but instead for the computer to play itself so I can watch (and hear) sports again. Would I do this while real people were playing? No. But in the absence of live games, it does the job surprisingly well. Definitely worth the $20 spent on both titles.

Stay inside. It helps us identify the assholes and morons.
