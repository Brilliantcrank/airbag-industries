When web 3.0 comes out it better have the following or I’m going to be pissed:

- Lasers.
- Buffalo rides for a quarter.
- Prisoner re-runs on SciFi.
- Words that start with a silent X.
- Badminton zip-zap action.
- The ability to re-route power from auxiliary sources to a primary function.
- W3C sanctioned user validation (Why are we letting the mouth breathers steer the ship? Web 3.0 will require an intelligence test to drive, sorry Arkansas you can use Gopher)
- A five year sentence of hard, Oz-like, time for using the colors pink and light blue together with any word — real or made up — that ends in the word ‘r’.
- S-words.
- Field trips, lots of them.
- Textmate that works with <strike>anti</strike> aliased fonts.
- Monkey Helpers on the Plane.
- Asynchronous Javascript and XML through calculator watches.
- Parachute pants (red).
- A national holiday.
