Iraqi militants, [fuming that their GI kidnapping has been found out to be a not-so-elaborate miniature hoax](http://cnn.worldnews.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=CNN.com+-+U.S.+military%3A+No+soldier+missing+in+Iraq+-+Feb+1%2C+2005&expire=03%2F3%2F2005&urlID=13075944&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2005%2FWORLD%2Fmeast%2F02%2F01%2Firaq.hostage.ap%2Findex.html&partnerID=2006) have announced they have kidnapped another US military person — for real this time. No really, they mean it.  

[![](https://www.airbagindustries.com/bucket/smbarbie.jpg)](https://www.airbagindustries.com/bucket/barbie.jpg) In this [updated photo](https://www.airbagindustries.com/bucket/barbie.jpg), Iraqi militants are now claiming they have kidnapped a female G.I. who they say goes by the name Princess Barb — as translated from their website:

> She is the meanest and bustiest hot chick storming the desert to kill insurgents where ever they may raise their little heads.  
>
> Death to infidels! Death to brunettes!
