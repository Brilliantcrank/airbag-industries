Despite the rough appearance, Airbag is back and better than ever—Six Million Dollar style. It was a bit of slog to get here, but with the help of Jesse from [Plasticmind](https://plasticmind.com "Plasticmind"), this old site has been restored, rebuilt, and improved.

From 2006-2019 this site ran on an original Mac mini tucked into a co-location facility in Costa Mesa, California. Running on [Movable Type 3.2](https://ma.tt/2005/07/movable-type-32/) (pour one out), it chugged along just fine until earlier this year when the mini just stopped working. A heroic effort was made by Leo at [AtlantisNet](https://atlantisnet.com "AtlantisNet") to save the drive—save the content—but alas, it was too late.

Jesse was already planning on how to clean up years of content and bring it into a new platform. The death of the Mac just made the project more difficult. Thankfully Jesse took on the additional work as a challenge and began the process of scrapping the content from a recent static backup that I did a few months before the site died.

Many moons passed, and punches from the punch list were punched.

Airbag is now living on a combination of Github, Hugo, Netlify, and Forestry. Jesse will provide details in a blog post he's writing. There is still much work to do, but that’s mostly on my plate. I’ve got a redesign and a rebrand in the works. And a bit of strategy couldn’t hurt. Having the site live now provides the much-needed pressure to get this done sooner than later.
