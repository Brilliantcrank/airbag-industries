I would love to see some type of election reform in this country because I think it’s been a long, long time coming. And it would be nice to have a voter turnout higher than that of the baby democracies that we are so keen on making happen in other parts of the country.  

It’s pretty pathetic when people in this country can’t make it to the polls when you consider that Iraqis dodged bullets and suicide bombers for a chance to participate in their election. And though I would love too bash voter apathy again, I will refrain from talking about the low-life scum in this country who don’t make an effort to get off their ass to vote. I’ll save that for another rainy day.  

Yesterday three members of the ‘We Think Voting is Rad’ club gathered on the steps of Capital Hill to [introduce legislation that will turn Election Day into a national holiday](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/print?id=510850). The bill also proposes allowing felons to vote (a nice touch), requiring paper vote receipts, and spending $500M to fix pot holes in democracy around the country.

> tanding with Massachusetts Sen. Kerry and other Democrats who had alleged voting irregularities in the 2004 contest, [Sen. Hillary Rodham] Clinton said, “Once again we had a federal election that demonstrates we have a long way to go. I think it’s also necessary to make sure our elections meet the highest national standards,” said the New York senator.”

Is it me or did Clinton just say that the United States is no longer considered the gold standard in democracy? Not that I don’t agree but did anyone else pick up on that? And since when do we have high national standards for elections? Where in the hell were these standards after the 2000?  

Blast me all you want but I think these people are the last ones we want pitching for making improvements in our democracy. For starters why kick this off in partisan fashion? Couldn’t they wait to announce this on another day when John McCain wasn’t getting his hair cut? I can’t imagine members from the other party refused to get on board but then again there is something to be said about standing close to open flames.

> Kerry, who lost the national contest by 3.3 million votes nationwide, and 118,000 within Ohio, denied the bill was an attempt to discredit the 2004 results.  
>
> “This has nothing to do with me,” said Kerry. “It is not partisan, or shouldn’t be.”

Dude, you just lost the biggest election in the world and you’re trying to sound like an impartial champion for American democracy? Take a page from Gore’s playbook and move away from anything election related for a while. Maybe you could join a technology company like your predecessor, I understand <span class="caps">HP</span> is hiring. Besides, don’t you have a war to stop or something?  

I digress.  

Indeed we do have a long way to go but unfortunately it’s going to require that both sides admit that the process that brought them to Washington isn’t the best we can do. Maybe then we can see real Democrat on Republican bipartisan legislation that not only addresses the issues above but also does away with connect-the-dots creative redistricting, mandates a required set of public debates for Presidential candidates (more than 3 please), and puts a cap on the absurd run-away costs of national campaigns.  

Of course I’d be a fool to think any real reform in our election process any time soon. Instead my gut tells me it’s time we all went shopping for Orange colored things and start preparing to march, protest, and riot in the streets of 2008.
