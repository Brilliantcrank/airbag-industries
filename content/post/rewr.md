Ariel Sharon: Bring out your dead! [clang] Bring out your dead! [clang]  

Nabil Shaath: Here’s one.  

Ariel Sharon: Ninepence.  

Yasser Arafat: I’m not dead!  

Ariel Sharon: What?  

Nabil Shaath: Nothing. Here’s your ninepence.  

Yasser Arafat: I’m not dead!  

Ariel Sharon: ‘Ere. He says he’s not dead!  

Nabil Shaath: Yes, he is.  

Yasser Arafat: I’m not!  

Ariel Sharon: He isn’t?  

Nabil Shaath: Well, he will be soon. He’s very ill.  

Yasser Arafat: I’m getting better!  

Nabil Shaath: No, you’re not. You’ll be stone dead in a moment.  

Ariel Sharon: Oh, I can’t take him like that. It’s against regulations.  

Yasser Arafat: I don’t want to go on the cart!  

Nabil Shaath: Oh, don’t be such a baby.  

Ariel Sharon: I can’t take him.  

Yasser Arafat: I feel fine!  

Nabil Shaath: Well, do us a favour.  

Ariel Sharon: I can’t.  

Nabil Shaath: Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes? He won’t be long.  

Ariel Sharon: No, I’ve got to go to the Robinsons’. They’ve lost nine today.  

Nabil Shaath: Well, when’s your next round?  

Ariel Sharon: Thursday.  

Yasser Arafat: I think I’ll go for a walk.  

Nabil Shaath: You’re not fooling anyone, you know. Look. Isn’t there something you can do?  

Yasser Arafat: [singing] I feel happy. I feel happy.  

[Sharon hits Yasser Arafat on the head – whop]  

Nabil Shaath: Ah, thanks very much.  

Ariel Sharon: Not at all. See you on Thursday.
