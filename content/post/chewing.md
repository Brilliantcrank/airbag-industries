1. If you preorder the new [*Moby <span class="caps">CD</span>*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000668IF/qid=1019524631/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_71_1/102-7473703-7061723) from Amazon, they will give you access to a streaming version until the album is released on May 14. It’s a pretty cool idea and works very well. I have been listening to *18* for a couple days now and so far the only downside is the lack of enthusiasm I have for this album. *Play* was much, much better.  

2. Last Sunday’s *Futurama* featured the all star cast of *Star Trek* minus one Dr. Bones. I love this show, mostly because it hits every <span class="caps">MTV</span> Generation bone I have. Fantastic writing but I admit that you have to really be into geekdom to get most of the non-verbal humor.  

On the flipside, *The Simpsons* needs to go. It should have exited stage left about two years ago. Matt, take a page from your [rhythm-guitarist-Steven-King](http://www.dqydj.com/rbr.htm) and let Homer go out on top.  

3. I’m getting tired of [*Batman*](http://www.batman.com/directcurrents/comics/Jun_19/ww_hike.html) (I read comics). His counter persona Bruce Wayne has been accused of murder. Rather than deal with it, Bruce deciedes to flee prison and pretends to go on the lamb all-the-while choosing to be Batman full time. The character is so full of himself I feel like I’m reading about someone like David Hasselholf. Yucky. At least Scott McDonald does a fantastic job with the art work.  

4. If you use Windows and like gaming then I urge you to download the 180mb demo of [Dungeon Siege](http://www.dungeonsiege.com/index.shtml) from Microsoft Games. It’s a combination of *Gaunlet*, *Bauldar’s Gate*, and *Diablo II* and features full Open <span class="caps">GL-3D</span> goodness. It is amazing how nice virtual game worlds are looking these days. It won’t be long before we have photo realistic realms of fantasy and fiction to go and play around. How long before we see the first person to live 24/7 in a virtual world?  

5. Other media digestion: *Theodore Rex* by Edmund Morris, *Temple of Low Men* by Crowded House, *Charter of the New Urbanism* by Congress for the New Urbanism, *The Rants, Raves & Thoughts of Fidel Castro* by <span class="caps">OYO</span> Publications, *Songs Yet to Be Sung* by Perry Farrell, and *Vanity Fair* — April issue.  

<span class="caps">ENCORE</span> — Amazon is so stinking slow. I just now tracked my order for *The Borne Identity* and see that [Jeff Bezos had to go back to December 31, 1969](https://www.airbagindustries.com/aft/amazon.gif) to find a copy and bring it back for processing in Roseburg, Oregon. I hope the Delorian is okay?!
