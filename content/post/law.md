After reading Tim’s [Blogger Code of Conduct](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/04/draft_bloggers_1.html) I have a few questions:


<div id="bullets">
  - I don’t see a link anywhere for buying my purple shroud. Is that coming soon or maybe that’s a browser issue? I use Safari.
- Are there [Lite Brites](http://www.hasbro.com/litebrite/default.cfm?page=Products/Detail&product_id=16174) in Heaven?
- Will oatmeal cookies be served with the special Kool-Aid or should I bring my own?
</div>
