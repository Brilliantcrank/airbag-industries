If you thought things in Iraq were all peaches and ice cream, as I did, well I guess you and I are sorely mistaken. Apparently the suits in Washington aren’t happy with those car bombs and political assassination thingies.

Hmmm, I’m not in the military but I’ll take a shot and say that the situation in Iraq is totally wacked.  

We don’t have enough troops to do the job and those service persons over there now are already over worked and stretched way beyond what should be. I think it’s also kitchen table knowledge that our troops don’t have the equipment they need (and in some cases promised) to perform the tasks they are assigned. With all of that going on I’ll assume that means morale is in the toilet and won’t improve no matter how many <span class="caps">USO</span> shows you host on the sand.
