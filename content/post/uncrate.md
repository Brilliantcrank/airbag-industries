<span class="caps">GARB: BROOKLYN BETA</span>/>  

Time flies when you’re being hip in Brooklyn. Recently described as “the new bohemia” by [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-07-26/brooklyn-rebirth-hip-bohemia-nets/57038550/1) a good time can be had by all but only if you’re ready to arrive in fashion that allows you to drop a kayak in a river and make a grilled cheese sandwich!  

The American Kef ($24.00). Slim Fit Ten-Pleat Tennis Collar Formal Tuxedo Shirt ($135.00). Levi’s Acid Wash Skinny Fit Jeans ($31.00). Motorola RAZR V3 ($43.00). Woodsman’s Hatchet (ETSY) River Ferret (Free). The Hathaway, Eye Patch ($29.95). Fila Skele-Toes EZ Slide Shoes ($49.95).  

Whatever your reason for being so rad in New York’s East Bank, [I’ll see you all in October.](https://brooklynbeta.org)
