This morning I bring you [required reading](https://fs.blog/2021/03/avoid-bad-decisions/) from the smart minds of [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog) (a smart group of people everyone should be reading). It's in the form of a list of the biggest reasons they make bad decisions. In my years as a leader in digital, I've come to know and council with a few hundred peers. Inevitably we share our victories, but more importantly, our defeats. What brings success for one group will very likely not work or apply to the next, but failure...it's my experience that was causes us to fail is almost universal.

If you want to succeed, learn from those who's success you wish for yourself in their stories of failure. Their trials and tribulations.

In this article the Farnam folks list their how they arrive at failure by making different types of bad decisions. Each failure comes with a rule in effort to prevent making the same mistake again. I'll paraphrase the list here:

* Being unintentionally stupid
* They solved the wrong problem
* Used bad data—bad information
* They failed to learn from previous mistakes
* Focused on optics over outcomes—my favorite

I'll add one that I've unfortunately had to witness first hand:

* Failure to believe in the potential to fail

Farnam provides a rule for each failure meant to help you avoid making the same mistakes. So I'll add a rule to the aforementioned mistake: What goes up will always come down—unless you progressively innovate on what the market needs.

I can't stress how y'all should read
