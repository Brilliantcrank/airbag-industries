A few weeks ago, my wife and I sold our beloved V.W. Toureg and replaced it with a pair of [VanMoof S3](https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/s3?color=dark) electric bikes. While we’re just getting started adapting to this different mode of transportation, it feels like the future. So when I read about the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment Act, I had to advocate for it.

As my friend and fellow e-bike aficionado [Colin writes](https://www.pastthepressbox.com/2021/04/tax-credits-for-ebikes-make-too-much-sense/):

> The legislation, if it were to become law, would provide a tax credit of 30 percent off (up to $1,500) a new electric bike priced at under $8,000. For Rad rides, my company of choice, that’d take about a $1,500 purchase down to around $1,000.

> It’s important to remember credits like these are not in any way radical. Even setting aside ebike tax credit efforts globally—if you buy an electric car in the United States, you get $7,500 back from the federal government.

As the precedent for promoting the sale of cleaner transportation through tax credits already exists as law, similar benefits for all types of alternate transit should be considered. Especially, EBIKE which is more accessible to more citizens. What’s good for folks who can and/or choose to drive a car should be made available to all financial classes.

If you are so inclined, take a few minutes and ask [your representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) to support H.R. 1019.
