Welcome to the new Airbag! A site to behold (no that is not a misspelling). Now before you start validating and measuring for curtains let me say that I still have some work to do, this project is not yet finished. I pushed back the deadline for six weeks and couldn’t bear another.  

**These guys are great!**  

I want to say thank-you to the following persons. All of whom shared opinions, helped fix style guides, and provided encouragement that resulted in the site you see here.  

[Tom Dolan](http://www.polychrome.org/), [Ryan Irelan](http://www.irelan.net/becoming), Jon Wiggens (site pending), [Dan Benjamin](http://www.hivelogic.com), [Blake Everingham](http://www.everomp.com) and [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com).  

For a complete list of people who have in some way touched this website, either through inspiration or <span class="caps">FTP</span>, take a look at the source code.  

**Who am I, and what is Airbag?**  

It’s possible that you are new to Airbag. For you I have written an extended piece for the [About](http://www.airbag.ca/about.shtml) page.  

**I am not Canadian, I live in California.**  

In trying to track down a new domain my choices were limited. Airbag.ca was available and I live in California (CA) so why not? Besides if I could live anywhere in North America, it would be British Columbia. Screw San Francisco, I left my heart in Vancouver.  

**Clothing is on the way.**  

I’ve already had several request for t-shirts and baseball caps featuring some of the artwork seen here. Don’t worry, the swag is on the way.  

**Ballast**  

There are problems which will surely be worked out in the next week or so. All I can say is, if you use Internet Explorer 5 for Macintosh, well God help ya. It’s not that bad but something is definitely working against me with that browser. A curse upon it’s creators!  

I realize (after Jeffrey pointed out) that the style guides could be better, faster, stronger. And I intend to make that happen in the weeks ahead. I’ll also get these pages validating <span class="caps">XHTML</span> Strict before you know it. Have Orange Book, will validate.  

**So now what?**  

Well I would like to get back to writing and linking and writing, and I have a new Shutterthumb to get ready for a February 1 launch date. Other plans are brewing for 2004, expect more announcements soon.
