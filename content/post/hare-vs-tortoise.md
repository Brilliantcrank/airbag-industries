I grew up without the glow of television. Thankfully my parents saw the wisdom in creating a household without the need of a box to provide entertainment or substitute child supervision.  

The result was a life filled with imagination, creation, and learning. To hell with television, I had better programming going on in my head than all the networks, including <span class="caps">HBO</span>, could ever come up with.  

Today I am seriously considering a similar move in my own household by turning off a different type of distraction — the 384mb Pacbell <span class="caps">DSL</span> connection attatched to a Netgear Wireless Router.



> It’s a matter of signal vs. noise;  

>  Reading vs. gaming;  

>  Designing vs. web browsing;  

>  Writing vs. downloading <span class="caps">mp3</span> files;  

>  Eating soup vs. Textism.



I’m not looking to become a broadband martyr, nor will I seek a twelve step program to deal with the gap left in my *Being Digital* lifestyle.  

However, here at Storeyhaus the Chairman of the Board is seriously considering downsizing household connectivity to a single 56k dial-up account — no second line.  

Not since the 20th century have I heard the squeal and whine of a modem handshaking with a telco switch — George Jetson be damned. Perhaps it’s time to re-learn patience and find out where my creativity went hithering off to.  

Also, the Secretary Treasure has informed me that slowing my baud down will also free up $600 in <span class="caps">FY’03</span> for the travel budget.  

Europe here I come.
