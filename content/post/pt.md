*This following discussion, “Medium vs. The Self-Hosted Blog,” occurred June 29 between 10:18-10:28 AM in the “ATX Built” Slack. Some dialogue was edited to protect the innocent from bad grammar.*  

**Professor Plum:** Has Medium killed the self-hosted blog? Does publishing on Medium make writers appear more “legit” (especially if you’re not web-famous like [Adactio](https://adactio.com) or [Daring Fireball](http://www.daringfireball.net))? Is there any advantage to hosting your blog on a personal site?  

**Professor Plum:** What if you’re an agency/business? Does anyone worry that their content (or at least URLs) might be gone if Medium calls it quits one day? I like owning my content, but it’s hard to beat the Medium platform for writing and publishing.  

**Mrs. Peacock:** I think it’s a great place for posting essays and thoughts. Just post to your blog first and cross-post to Medium. Too bad Mrs. White isn’t on here, her Medium post has 7000 views today!  

**Mrs. Scarlett:** Just invited Mrs. White, tell her to check her email.  

**Professor Plum:** I was thinking about that approach as well. I do like the idea of having posts on my site so that places that I’m interested in working at can see my work and writing in the same place.  

**Mrs. Peacock:** I also think it’s great for non-web famous people. Your posts look exactly the same as everyone else’s. If you write something worthwhile, people will respond.  

**Col. Mustard:** Medium is awesome for discovery. And you can still “own” your content.  

**Miss Scarlett:** Professor, I am totally a fan of cross-posting b/n your blog and medium. Medium gives you exposure outside your circle, but I like the idea of still “owning” my writing, so to speak, and keeping it on my blog.  

**Col. Mustard:** Lots of people publish both places similar to Linkedin.  

**Mrs. White:** Hello.  

**Mr. Green:** I’ll often post on my site, and then post to Medium. Then link to the Medium post with a “Recommend this article on Medium” type blurb somewhere on my site’s version.  

**Professor Plum:** So I guess the answer is just do both.  

**Miss Scarlett:** Also, from the perspective of someone Googling you, if they go to my site, I want them to stay there and view my writing without making them leave to Medium.  

**Mr. Green:** But Medium has offered me far more reach every single time than my site ever has.  

**Professor Plum:** Nice. They do a good job with the daily read emails.  

**Mr. Green:** Yeah, they do. One of the only of its kind that I actually insist on looking through daily without archiving right away, lol  

**Mrs. White:** I would definitely go for Medium. I am an indie web booster, and all, of course— post it on your own site too— but the readers are on Medium. There are lots of them, and If you get a boost by getting recommended by someone, it can be huge.  

**Col. Mustard:** /gliphy huge
