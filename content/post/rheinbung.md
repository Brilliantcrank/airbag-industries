On this fine Memorial Day morning I am in front of the widescreen watching [Sink the Bismark](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054310/) during <span class="caps">AMC</span>‘s weekend of war movies (interesting to note that this year most of the lineup is focused around <span class="caps">WWII</span> when the villains were well defined and victory was well pronounced).  

I openly admit to you the guilty pleasure of war movies, especially those that take place during the Second Great War. I studied this war during college to fulfill a young male’s curiosity and to complete a second major (I took history classes because I enjoy the subject, enough to qualify for a double major — which is a course of post-secondary education that I strongly recommend). As I grew up land-locked in the middle of Alaska I don’t know why but I especially fancy stories that happen at sea. I am not a big fan of the aquatic but there is something about the operations of a ship and the naval tradition that is both entertaining and very, very curious.  

Which brings me to a thought I had while watching this teleplay of [Britain’s historic military victory](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1345013.stm): What happened to games pertaining to warfare on the high seas?  

Earlier in life — during the 16-bit years — we had games like 688 Attack Sub and Sub Battle Simulator and while those focused on commanding a tube filled with torpedoes it was still a game of tactics in the high seas. Today this genre is almost forgotten while gaming across age and genders is at an all time high. Especially with current technology a naval battle simulation could be so much more immersive than the Amiga could ever provide. Sure it’s not FPS or MMORPG but commanding a fleet to sink another carries the challenge that those types of games can not provide.  

With today’s technology I would think it very possible to make an interesting multiplayer scenario with a group of players taking command of vessels as part of an armada or even to go one-on-one sub against sub or battleship against battleship. Harpoon is the only game of late that comes to mind but it hasn’t been updated in years (the <span class="caps">GUI</span> wreaks of <span class="caps">EGA</span> days) and for some reason big gaming companies don’t seem to think [these types of games can make money](http://www.harpoonhq.com/harpoon4.htm). Lame.  

Enough with the elves and orcs, give me a naval fleet and an opponent worth sinking.
