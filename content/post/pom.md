>  4. Golden Gate Bridge  

>  5. Disneyland



Upon hearing the news this morning, I went directly to Disneyland to have fun and to give Osama and crew the middle finger. Thankfully, I didn’t see any anthrax, dirty bombs, or Iraqis.  

However, I did see (what had to be) the largest gathering in the world of Jr. Varsity cheerleaders and their very obnoxious curly hair bun things.  

Kudos goes to Disneyland security for using thousands of ‘<span class="caps">READY! OK!</span>‘ agents to thwart a potential terrorist attack.  

It was enough to drive even me away.  

Also, you will be happy to know that [Matterhorn](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/dlr/detail/attraction?id=MatterhornBobsledsAttractionPage) and [King Arthur Carrousel](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/dlr/detail/attraction?id=KingArthurCarrouselAttractionPage) are finally open again.
