While I am still recovering from back to back colds, holiday travel to the Bay Area and a grand wedding in Canada I want to at least get the <span class="caps">XML</span> feeds properly restored.  

I think I’m almost there but right now I don’t have a lot of time, nor the resources, to test the feeds in every contraption that’s available these days for pulling down <span class="caps">XML</span>. I have noticed that while the format for the [Airbag feed](http://www.airbagindustries.com/index.xml) is more to my liking, it no longer links to the entry. I tried wrapping the MTEntryExcerpt with a MTEntryPermalink but that just seems to break everything entirely.  

If anyone has any ideas for improving the XML feed and restore the permalink please do chime in. It does appear the feed for [Longboard](http://www.airbagindustries.com/longboard.xml) is back to perfect health but again, you tell me.  

One more thing, Tom DeLay is a uber asshat. Make a note of it.
