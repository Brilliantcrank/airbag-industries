I’ve always liked Idaho and now I like it even more. The 58th Idaho Legislature House of Representatives and the Senate recently passed House Concurrent Resolution 29 that includes clauses such as the following:

> <span class="caps">WHEREAS</span>, any members of the House of Representatives or the Senate of the Legislature of the State of Idaho who choose to vote “Nay” on this concurrent resolution are “FREAKIN’ IDIOTS!” and run the risk of having the “Worst Day of Their Lives!”

The suits in Boise — for you American school children that’s state capital of Idaho — took the time to [commend Jared and Jerusha Hess and the city of Preston](http://www3.state.id.us/oasis/HCR029.html) for their movie [Napoleon Dynamite](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JNBQ/ref=nosim/airbag-20). I dare say you will have a hard time finding another resolution anywhere that includes words like “chickens with talons”, “Tina the Llama”, and “Kip’s relationship with LaFawnduh.”  

I’m slightly disappointed they left out any mention of “secret ninja moves from the government”, but maybe that’s because it’s classified information.

For the record, that makes two entries in a row that contain the words “tater tots”, sweet.  

And speaking of movies, Batman Begins, unlike it’s predecessors, is extremely entertaining and very well done. It was a pleasure to see Gary Oldman in a supporting, good-guy role while Liam Neeson delivered the perfect villain.
