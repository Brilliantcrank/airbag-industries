I’m dragging my feet cause I have work to do (sigh) but it’s Saturday. I should be outside doing something useless. Fortunately my work entails designing a group blog for teens. Unfortunately, I may not be into their scene enough to know what’s cool and what’s not. I do know not to use words like teen, rad, or awesome.  

The goal for the site is to be a big peer group for other young people who are having problems with addictions, self image, etc. Some high school volunteers have agreed to post on a regular basis to the site, describing how they deal with everyday problems.  

It’s also a front for free online counseling for those young people who are contemplating suicide. Hopefully no one ever has to use that part of the site.  

So I’m off to do a little research in cool. Or is that phat? Either way, I just need to get to work. If you have any suggestions please leave them here. I need all the help I can get.
