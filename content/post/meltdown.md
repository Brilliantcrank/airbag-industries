Facebook, the global leader in online privacy protection, is working on an upgrade to their privacy options that will require the new Facebook Privacy Control Center® to be installed in every user’s home. At this time the planned array of privacy options will require approximately 5000 sq. ft. of controls, dials, notebooks, drink holders, and several monitors. Facebook is working around the clock to integrate the use of microchip technology which should reduce the footprint to the size of a Buick Electra by late fall of 2014.
