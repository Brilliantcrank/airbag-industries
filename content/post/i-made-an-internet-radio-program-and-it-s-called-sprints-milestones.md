I’m pleased as punch to share that a friend and I have begun recording the first season of a podcast called [Sprints and Milestones](http://sprintsandmilestones.com/).

[Brett Harned](https://medium.com/@brettharned) — one-time co-worker and a long time friend of mine — wrote a book last fall called [_Project Management for Humans_](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/project-management-for-humans/). After reading the first draft, I asked about Brett’s plans to market the book and suggested that he start a podcast to help continue the lift that new books typically get when they launch.

Many, many months later we finally have a program that not only compliments the many messages in the book but should provide useful to anyone who has to manage projects whether it’s a part of their job or a full-time role. We had a lot of fun putting the show together, and we’ve already got a handful of ideas to keep things fun and informative in the future.

[We’ve set up a newsletter to keep people informed of new episodes along with updates on interesting news and events in the world of digital project management.](https://sprintsandmilestones.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=d1f549baada87a8de7aac3c65&id=b759535ac2) Give us your email address; I promise it will be worth it.
