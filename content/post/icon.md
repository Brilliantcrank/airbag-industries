A USO show. BOB HOPE stands in the wings with an ADVANCE MAN.



<div align="center"><span class="caps">BOB HOPE</span></div>> What’s the mayor’s name?



<div align="center"><span class="caps">ADVANCE MAN</span></div>> Quimby.



<div align="center"><span class="caps">BOB HOPE</span></div>> Beautiful.



Bob goes on stage in front of thousands of ROWDY G.I.’s.



<div align="center"><span class="caps">BOB HOPE</span></div>> Hello, this is Bob “what the hell am I doing in Springfield” Hope. Hey, how about that Mayor Quimby? He’s some golfer! His balls spend more time under water than Greg Louganis.
