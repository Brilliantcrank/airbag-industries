[![](https://www.airbagindustries.com/bucket/johnny.jpg)](http://www.cafepress.com/3gamedeficit)Tell me you watched the Redsox trounce on the Yankees tonight. Do you realize that in the first time ever in Major League Baseball’s one-hundred plus year history a team was able to come back from a three game deficit during a championship? It was nothing short of amazing — the Miracle in the Diamond.  

Also exciting is Boston’s first champinship victory in decades. I believe we were still paying tax to the throne of England when last the Sox were doing so good. Again, not being a really big sports guy I can’t claim any one team over another but I do appreciate the historical significance of tonight events. So much so that I decided to hit Photoshop and try and contain my excitement.  

I’m quite pleased with the result, I hope you are too.  

And as requsted, here are a few desktops for those who want more than just a t-shirt: [1024×768](https://www.airbagindustries.com/bucket/grandslam_1024x768.jpg), [1280×1024](https://www.airbagindustries.com/bucket/grandslam_1280x1024.jpg) and [1600×1280](https://www.airbagindustries.com/bucket/grandslam_1600x1280.jpg)  

Meanwhile, tonight’s season premiere of West Wing sucked hard. I don’t know (nor do I care) who the monkey’s are <span class="caps">NBC</span> hired to write this show but it’s gone down hill since Sorkin left. What is it about American television that they can’t get past three year wall? I’m surprised the actors and actresses put up with such shoddy writing.
