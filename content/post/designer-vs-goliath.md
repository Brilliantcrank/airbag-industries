I’m currently taking [Seth Godin’s](https://seths.blog) class on [podcasts](https://akimbo.com/thepodcastingworkshop). As part of the class, I have come up with a few ideas for a program called Designer vs Goliath, a podcast for designers who are seriously outnumbered by developers and engineers.   
  
In the last five years, I have discovered lone designers tucked into the corners of the enterprise, startups, and everyday small businesses. These are designers who rarely get to perform design-related tasks like user research or participate in a design critique. Yet they churn out the work that powers Billions of dollars in revenue. They need a community as much, if not more, so let’s go find them.  
  
Are you (or do you know) a lone designer surrounded by an army of developers, engineers, and product managers? Do you watch videos of design teams collaborating, hosting critiques, discussing typography, and wish you were there? I’d like to hear from you and know if you might find this type of program worthwhile.  
  
I’ve put together this [short survey](https://brilliantcrank.typeform.com/to/lGAI27Wf) that I hope you’ll complete. And please consider sharing this post with your network even if you don’t fit the mold of a Designer vs Goliath.
