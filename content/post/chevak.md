A few nights ago a <span class="caps">SOLD</span> marker replaced the <span class="caps">BY APPOINTMENT ONLY</span> on top of a <span class="caps">for sale</span> sign in front of my Orange County home. After five years of good times and hardship we are migrating north-west for greener pastures and a shorter commute. I’ve got enough miles on the train that they have named a freight car after me, I only wish they would have used Myriad, not [Brooklyn Kid](http://moorstation.org/typoasis/graffiti/grf01.htm).  

Meanwhile, the design devaluing competition heats up with more angst and entries continue to trickle in from all over the world. Apparently holding a design contest is right up there with clubbing baby seals and laughing at cancer patients. Who knew?  

And if you happen to browse the January/February issue of Communication Arts don’t be in such a hurry to read the article on blogs where Airbag gets a mention for being part of the [Design Eye for the Usability Guy](http://www.designbyfire.com/000094.html). Instead, please turn to [Guns, Butter and Ballots](http://www.commarts.com/ca/coldesign/johE_261.html) (page 14 in your CA) in which the [redesign of the Presidential daily briefing memo](http://www.commarts.com/ca/coldesign/johE_261.html) gets top billing. The article goes on to highlight other initiatives by citizens to improve our government through better design.
