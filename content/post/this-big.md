My head is pulsing just right underneath the muscle layer that surrounds my brain. I have caught the truck driver’s cold.  

No matter where I lay I can’t get comfortable, my back is aching, my neck feels contorted, and the thought of eating just isn’t happening.  

I called in sick today as well I should and took the opportunity to finish watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, an anime series set in the future that features heavy religious tones and ninja robot action.  

I have absolutely no idea what happened in the end, the last three episodes didn’t make any sense. It was like the end of *Monty Python’s Holy Grail* (a spoof on the Arthur Legend) when London police come out of the woods and arrest King Arthur and Sir Lancelot for murder.  

What?  

Exactly!  

Just thinking about it makes my head hurt worse.  

On Saturday my wife and her friend are hosting a Fall Tea Party just two feet from the couch that I am using as a sick bed. Fifteen lovely ladies are coming to sip darjeeling and nip at scones in the very place I have chosen to heal.  

How lovely.  

I think I’ll phone London’s finest first thing in the morning.
