If you are just waking up, as I am, then you may have missed the nice words from Mschmidt of K10k as [posted](http://www.k10k.net/newspost.aspx?id=8282) some six hours ago.  

He writes, “The [nominees](https://www.airbagindustries.com/bloggies.html) for The 2003 Bloggies were put online a couple of days ago… In there, these little gems were also spotted: [Loobylu](http://www.loobylu.com/) and Airbag both of which are living proof that writings need not be visually boring.”  

The design part took some tinkering but at least it was fun. Now if I could just make the writing need not be boring — stupid *Elementary Principals of Composition!* Where does William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White get off anyway?  

Thank you Mshmidt for your kind accolade. As for everyone else, tonight I will be hosting the First Annual Airbag Cocktail Party over at [Pirated Sites](http://www.pirated-sites.com/).
