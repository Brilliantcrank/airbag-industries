This afternoon I had a horrific experience.  

I received an email invitation to join Friendster, the last desperate hold out for dating people online. I suppose it could also be used for other things, like that randy dandy thing called making new friends.  

As described by the invitation:



> Friendster is an online community that connects people through networks of friends for dating or making new friends.  

>  Friendster is for people who are single, people in relationships, and  

>  anyone who wants to make new friends or help their friends meet new people.  

>  You can use Friendster to:  

>  * Meet new people to date, through your friends and their friends  

>  * Make new friends  

>  * Help your friends meet new people



Well that’s pretty cool, if you like people.  

As for me I prefer quiet solace of an empty room, one window please.  

Still, it’s not fair that people who prefer people should get all the cool web applications. Just because I’m Introverted doesn’t mean I don’t have needs too.  

I have a hunch that I’m not alone.  

So for you and me, Joe Goaway, I present [Introvertster – The new way to get rid of people.](https://www.airbagindustries.com/introvertster)
