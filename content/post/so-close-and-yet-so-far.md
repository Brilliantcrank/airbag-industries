I'm on the other side of a server and site rebuild thanks to a remarkable developer who is helpful, kind, and supportive. They will receive public accolade _after_ the success of this project is ensured. Meanwhile, I am starting to dig into redesigning this site as I'm receiving more and more prompts to write again. Things will get ugly before they look sharp like they did back in 2006.

A handful of book ideas have come my way in the last six months from people whom I respect. Primarily because they are authors themselves _and_ the ideas behind the books are solid. At the same time I'm not eager to jump in because these same folks, and other successful writers I know, have nothing very positive to say about the experience. In fact all I've heard about book writing is mostly bitching about how much it sucks. And the level of reward received for the experience isn't shared across this group. Some make out like a bandit while others don't see any serious return on their time investment. If you have any inspirational words, I'm all ears.

In the meantime, I'll continue to keep reading and take notes for future blog posts.
