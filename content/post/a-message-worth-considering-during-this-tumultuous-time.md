My brother-in-law just sent me a text with a smart and thoughtful message in response to these uncertain and stressful times. I’m sharing it here because I think more people ought to consider this perspective.

> Just my thoughts, but need to get this out there. November is finally here. I have seen a lot of hate spewed in recent months about a man who is a constant winner and overachiever, and that's what the people who support him like about him. Yes, he's been caught in lies and twisted the truth a little but he's still out there proving his haters wrong time after time. Some people are jealous of someone who is successful, powerful, and has a lot of money. Throw in a hot foreign model at his side and they hate him even more. You may not have wanted him in his role, but he's there now and there's nothing you can do about it. I know it’s possibly going to get worse over the next several days, but like him or not, Tom Brady is really turning things around in Tampa.

Perhaps satire is not dead yet.
