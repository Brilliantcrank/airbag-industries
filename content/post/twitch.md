One of the better jobs in the world is now available for those whom have qualifications. It makes me wonder what in the hell I’m doing, fretting about things like <span class="caps">CSS</span>, <span class="caps">XHTML</span>, standards and browsers when I could be doing [this](http://www.blizzard.com/jobopp/gamemaster.shtml)?  

Feeling a little ‘Mosquito Coast-ish’ right about now.
