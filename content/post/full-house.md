1. Like [public squabbling](http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=1005)? Me too. Peter David, writer of *Captain Marvel*, publicly called his publisher out. Only break dance fighting is better than this because in comic fights, there’s no rad music or cardboard mats to do the catipillar on. It’s a classic battle pitting creative against management in the wonderful industry of comic books.  

2. <span class="caps">KCRW</span>‘s [*Metropolis*](http://www.kcrw.org/show/mt) is three hours of electronica that can’t be found anywhere else. The good news is they stream in every format known to man. And it’s an <span class="caps">NPR</span> station! Take a listen from <span class="caps">7 – 10 PM (PST)</span>.  

3. Did I mention [Movabletype](http://www.movabletype.org) 2.0 rocks? Now feature filled with everything you could possibly want from an easy to use and install content management system. I stand by what I said earlier: Blogger users, it’s time to upgrade. Radio Userlander’s, it’s time to defect.  

4. I am contemplating a migration to [<span class="caps">XP</span>](http://communities.msn.com/WindowsXPSucks). Trying to fight peer pressure at work where I am surrounded by Microsoft junkies. It doesn’t help that every time I walk by a game store and see that Castle Wolfenstien has been out for Windows for some time, while it’s nowhere near ready for shipping to Mac users. Help, help, I being repressed!  

5. The other day I forgot to introduce another website linked from Airbag. Go see the [Barking Moose](http://www.barkingmoose.com), not to be confused with Sleepy, Grumpy, or Bashful Moose. Right now he’s dissing on Zeldman’s declaration of the imending death of Verdana as the font du jour. Neee!
