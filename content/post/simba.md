SecState: Waaasssaaappp!!!  

SecState: Condiâ€™s in here moving furniture around and trying to find a good spot for her war-fractured bust of Sadam.  

Airbag: Are you serious?  

SecState: Totally, some Marine brought it to her hoping to get a promotion.  

Airbag: No I mean about Iran!  

SecState: ðŸ™‚  

Airbag: I knew it! <span class="caps">LOL</span>.  

Airbag: Adapting missiles for nukes. Oh man you had me on edge. You suck!  

SecState: <span class="caps">LOL</span>.  

Airbag: Iâ€™m gonna have to get you back on this one.  

SecState: ðŸ˜›  

Airbag: Remember last timeâ€¦  

Airbag: Youâ€™re all: portable chemical weapons labs, aluminum tubes!  

Airbag: And Iâ€™m all: wolf, wolf!  

SecState: <span class="caps">LOLMAO!!!</span>  

Airbag: <span class="caps">LOL!</span>  

SecState: Dude, Iâ€™m so bored.  

SecState: Condi thinks I should go to Africa on the governmentâ€™s tab but screw Africa, dude, like I need another giraffe pelt.  

Airbag: Yeah itâ€™s like almost one is too many. And they kinda smell.  

SecState: So I thought, Iâ€™ll pull another fast one before I blow the doors to this place. I had Dan Rather in here and I told him I have an intelligence report from Tibet that proves Iran also stole all of Sadamâ€™s <span class="caps">WMD</span> while he was eating Marrs Bars in that gofer hole.  

Airbag: Brilliant!  

SecState: Yeah his eyes started watering, leg was all shaking and he kept mumbling: courage, courage like he was Forrest Gump or something.  

SecState: That cracka aintâ€™ right. I donâ€™t think he should be hitting the tanning bed anymore itâ€™s wacked his brain.  

Airbag: Is he really alive? He looks like heâ€™s drinking embalming fluid for cocktails.  

SecState: Dude, they have to give him the paddles before going on television.  

SecState: The countdown guy goes to 3 and then they hit him with some Joules to get a pulse.  

Airbag: Like Strange Brew! Hey hoser you gonna read the news or what?  

Airbag: And here I thought he was being animated by Pixar, amazing.  

SecState: Gotta go, Paul Wolfowitz is in the building, time to put some hurt on! Gonna grab me some heavy pipe hitting Marinesâ€¦  

Airbag: Give him a purple titty-twister Diablo style!
