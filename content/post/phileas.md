What does twenty-four hours of Airbag look like? I want to know.  

I would love to see a snapshot of Airbag around the world starting and ending somewhere around the International Date Line. If you have a minute take a photo of how you normally digest my attempts molding the English language into sentences and if the response is decent I’ll whip something up for us all to take a look at.  

Send said photo (no screen shots please lets get some local flavor in the view finder) to [this email address](mailto:airbag@gmail.com)—post no photos to the comments please—along with your name, town/city, country, time zone, and the time in which you preserved the moment in pictures.  

Oh, and be sure to include the <span class="caps">URL</span> to your own website. No reason why you shouldn’t get some link love out of the deal.  

<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: Submissions have started to come in from Australia, United Kingdom and various time zones across the <span class="caps">US</span>. For example:

This lovely photo comes form Michelle Park who writes [The Jam Jar](http://thejamjar.com/) and lives in <span class="caps">GMT</span> +10 hours.  

Now, I didn’t mean to leave the impression that this was started and finished in a day. I’m more interested in seeing how many much of the <span class="caps">GMT</span> we can fill.
