> “Going to war without France is like going deer hunting without your accordion.”

There has been much laughter, and many Google search queries, over the lack of results when searching for [*French Military Victories*](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/text/victories.html).  

Some of you have run to the side of our European ‘ally’, waving a history book and pointing to that short little military dictator who liked to travel around Europe with lots and lots of men and big cannons (nudge, nudge, say no more, wink, wink).  

Not convinced that France matters much, I did a little research and came up with their war scorecard. The home of Inspector Clouseau, Dean Allen, and Jerry Lewis, has a win-tie-loss record of 2-3-12. There was the [successful attack on Greenpeace](http://www.kauricoast.co.nz/Feature.cfm?WPID=70) in July 1985, but it does not count as a war because the conflict lasted less than 24 hours. Instead the matter was merely labeled as just another Frenchie thing to do.  

In fact, Amnesty International continues to be on alert status ‘Orange’ whenever [France](https://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/000215.shtml) is concerned.
