Jesse shares his story and insights of hosting a daily video "room" during COVID-19. This is my favorite insight because I've experienced the same outcome from a handful of virtual groups that I have both lead and been a participant in the last year.

> I firmly believe that much of the meaningfulness of this community can be chalked up to human beings caring about other human beings. People just wanted to have someone to talk to about their fears and concerns, someone to celebrate their victories with and share their pain, someone to ask about them when they’re not there. I’m very thankful for a group of people I was able to do that with.

What a great milestone to share with a community that didn't really exist a year ago. Leaders have much to learn from this, especially as they consider a post-COVID work place.
