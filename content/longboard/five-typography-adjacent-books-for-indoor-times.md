A much-appreciated list from Mr. Jonathan Hoefler who writes:

> All five \[books\] share a sincerity, an attention to detail, and a sense of humor that has kept me smiling for weeks. I hope youâ€™ll enjoy them as much as I have.

If reading is not your thing then I encourage you to stop watching tiger trash and enjoy [Jonathan's episode of Abstract](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057883 "Johnathan Hoefler on typography") on the subject of typography.
