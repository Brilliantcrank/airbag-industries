A "real-time inspection tool" that scans websites for tracking technology.

> Who is peeking over your shoulder while you work, watch videos, learn, explore, and shop on the internet? Enter the address of any website, and Blacklight will scan it and reveal the specific user-tracking technologies on the site—and who’s getting your data. You may be surprised at what you learn.

I encourage you to check a few websites that you frequent and be prepared for a surprise or two. For instance, [Medium](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=medium.com) has one ad tracker and one third-party cookie, whereas the [New York Times](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=nytimes.com) has twenty-one ad trackers and twenty-six third-party cookies in use, and they allow Facebook and Google to track your web use outside their domain. Way not cool.
