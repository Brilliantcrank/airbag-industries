> As a strategy, modern brands represent a specific business model. This model unlocks new sources of value at the time of economic involution. Modern brands make their products and services valuable beyond their function and utility; they build an architecture to deliver new value (like subscription or membership); and then find a new way to harness this value and turn it into profit.

This approach sounds very similar to [David Hieatt's strategy](https://thedobook.co/products/do-open-how-a-simple-email-newsletter-can-transform-your-business-and-it-can) for building the [Hiut Demum](https://hiutdenim.co.uk). Very digital-first, but it would seem that it works for more than things made of ones and zeros.
