title = "Medium has acquired a “social digital book platform” called Glose."

+++
The platform “reaches more than one million readers in 200 countries. Boasting a wide range of fiction and nonfiction, Glose carries ebooks and audiobooks from all major publishers, including Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Hachette, and Simon & Schuster.”

The move seems to have been made to help Medium members discover (and therefore synthesize and share) more ideas. From Medium founder Ev:

> _Books are a means of exploring an idea, a way to go deeper. The vast majority of the world’s ideas are stored in books and journals, yet are hardly searchable nor shareable. With Glose, we want to improve that experience within Medium’s large network of engaged readers and writers._

Even more exciting, [Medium intends to explore new ideas to evolve Glose beyond what it is today.](https://ev.medium.com/lets-rethink-the-book-experience-3087baa3cc91) Again from Ev:

> _We want to rethink the book-reading experience, and we’re hiring. If you’re a certain type of book-loving designer, product person, or engineer, this might be a dream job for you. Did I mention the books team will be based in Paris?_

Travail de rêve en effet!
