An insightful essay from Ethan on the cost of dedicated design tools and development decisions that may not scale outside of engineering.

> Modern digital teams rarely discuss decisions in terms of the _collaborative costs_ they incur. It’s tempting—and natural!—to see design- or engineering-related decisions in isolation: that selecting Vue as a front-end framework only impacts the engineering team, or that migrating to Figma only impacts designers. But each of these changes the way that team works, which impacts how other teams will work and collaborate with them.

If you're in the business I encourage you to read and re-read this post because it alludes to another evolution in our industry that will shake things up. It's not clear if will be good or bad (for designers and/or developers) but it has the potential to be bigger than Responsive and Ajax combined.
