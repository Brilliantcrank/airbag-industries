The work was a joint effort between artist Imogen Heap and a UK based creative agency called Field. I enjoyed the story behind this work (near the bottom of the page) and how Imogen seemingly wandered around Armonk—IBM headquarters—to record different sounds to incorporate in the work. It reminded me of watching Ben Burtt share his [many stories on creating sounds for Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So0nmciiFJg "Ben Burtt shares stories on creating sounds for Star Wars") in a similar fashion. And any time [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/ "IBM Plex") (one of the all-time best type families) gets front-row attention it's worth sharing.
