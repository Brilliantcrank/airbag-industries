Very curious. Perhaps it’s too early to come out with the full intent behind this acquisition, but the words “create” and "publish" are missing from the press release. I expected something more from a company that has built an empire on making tools for content creation. A year ago SiriusXM purchased Simplecast, a platform for publishing and distributing podcasts. An acquisition like that for Automattic would have made more sense to me. Perhaps they're just looking to join the rest fo the world in trying to cash in on the multi-billion dollar podcast world.

Whatever comes of this, I’m happy to see Pocket Casts join Automattic. I’ve been a user for many years, and glad to see they are in good hands. Pocket Casts is by far the best cross-platform podcast experience on the market today. I use it on MacOS, iOS, WatchOS, and CarPlay and it’s flawless.

One more thing, I’d like to point out to my video-loving friends that listening continues to trump watching.
