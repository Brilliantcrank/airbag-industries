Medium asked for advice, and writers answered the call. I laughed when I came across this tip because I don't know that I've come across anyone else who does this:

> If I’m stuck on a section, I simply insert a row of X’s: XXXXXX as a marker to come back to later.

This method helps a lot by the way—to get as many of your thoughts into words as possible. I use the second pass to fill in the gaps and X's. It's not until the third-or-fourth pass that I check for spelling and grammar. If the story doesn't make sense, then correct spelling and grammar do not matter—it's still a fail.

Everyone should consider bookmarking this article and saving it to Pocket for later reference. There is a lot of great advice here for all kinds of situations.
