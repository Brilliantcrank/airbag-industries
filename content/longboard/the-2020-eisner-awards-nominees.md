It's a shame that Valiant did not make the list this year. _Immortal Hulk, Doctor Doom, Invisible Kingdom, Once & Future, and Undiscovered Country_ were all delightful news to me and I picked up the first story arc for all of the titles (Marvel books are on sale right now and regularly). I also came upon _The White Trees, Afterlift_, and _Starship Down_. I love it when the Eisner Awards points me to titles I would have never considered checking out otherwise.
