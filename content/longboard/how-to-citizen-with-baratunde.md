A new podcast (to me) that I read about in the most recent issues of [Dense Discovery](https://www.densediscovery.com).

> _How To Citizen with Baratunde_ reimagines the word “citizen” as a verb and reminds us how to wield our collective power. So many of us want to do more in response to the problems we hear about constantly, but where and how to participate can leave us feeling overwhelmed and helpless. Voting, while critically important, simply isn’t enough. It takes more to make this experiment in self-governance work. Listen in to learn new perspectives and practices from people working to improve society for the many.

I'm intrigued by the premise as I've been thinking about how to make the most out of the next twenty years. How to contribute in a way to really fix problems rather than apply more patches.
