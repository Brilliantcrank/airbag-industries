I abhor silos, fiefdoms, and territories in the workplace. They are the toxic result of poor leadership, but that doesn’t mean we have to live with it. If you agree, then you’re going to love [Misook Ji’s](https://www.misookji.com) article. It is a design-centric call to action, every company should consider, and if you need a reason why Misook states it right up front:

> Strong cross-discipline collaboration between design, research, engineering, and product management, makes a huge difference in adding value for consumers and businesses. Accenture’s[ _Together Makes Better _](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/Thought-Leadership-Assets/PDF-3/Accenture-IndustryX0-Out-Collaborate-the-Crisis-v3.pdf#zoom=50)reports that companies that invested in cross-functional collaboration to drive digital transformation enjoyed 27% earnings growth from 2017 to 2019, while those that didn’t only achieve 2% growth.

The bottom line—collaboration equals positive revenue growth. Cross-discipline collaboration, when done right, means better communication, stronger ideas, and faster execution. Yes, this article emphasized product teams (design, engineering, management), but this approach works in every place where there are cross-discipline dependencies.
