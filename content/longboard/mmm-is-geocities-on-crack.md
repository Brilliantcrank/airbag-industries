Mmm is a fully responsive, “dead simple, drag and drop” website creation tool. No, not like Squarespace or Wix, or WordPress. This is [amazing](https://mmm.page/xh.main), [wonderful](https://mmm.page/ryanseslow.parttwo), and [super fun](https://mmm.page/kaitonishimura.main), like making Portland for the Internet. Sure, mmm is super niche, but it’s fantastic to see the development of a tool that gets people thinking about this medium differently again.
