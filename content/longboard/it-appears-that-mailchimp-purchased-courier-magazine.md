Wow! From their email announcement:

> We’re excited to share that [Courier](https://couriermedia.co), a London-based media company, has recently joined the Mailchimp family. Courier’s mission is to help modern small business founders and entrepreneurs like you work smarter, realize your dreams, and live life on your terms. And starting today, we’re bringing Courier’s stories, interviews, and guides to the [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f7b9ee22124ff6454424dc10c&id=bd6709fcd7&e=c80e98c50f) site, so all our customers can benefit from their insights.
