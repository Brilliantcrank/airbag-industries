Given the metric tons of shit we're all dealing with right now, it's nice to have some comedy back in our lives. Watch the trailer and you'll see for yourself, the writing is just as sharp and smart as it was. And it proves that while satire might need a break, comedy—when done right—still works.

What's that? You don't like animation? Either learn to appreciate the format and have a laugh or go grow some grass from seeds you harvested one at a time.
