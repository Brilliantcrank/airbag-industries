> At first, I didn’t recognize the symptoms that we all had in common. Friends mentioned that they were having trouble concentrating. Colleagues reported that even with vaccines on the horizon, they weren’t excited about 2021. It wasn’t burnout — we still had energy. It wasn’t depression — we didn’t feel hopeless. We just felt somewhat joyless and aimless. It turns out there’s a name for that: [languishing](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3090197).

> Languishing is a sense of stagnation and emptiness. It feels as if you’re muddling through your days, looking at your life through a foggy windshield.

I found myself immediately relating to this article and I know more than a few of you who will too. As I started to read the article I thought, okay, no biggie, until this paragraph.

> Languishing is the neglected middle child of mental health. It’s the void between depression and flourishing — the [absence of well-being](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-04013-013). You don’t have symptoms of mental illness, but you’re not the picture of mental health either. You’re not functioning at full capacity. Languishing dulls your motivation, disrupts your ability to focus, and [triples](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3090197) the odds that you’ll cut back on work. It appears to be [more common](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-04013-013) than major depression — and in some ways it may be a bigger risk factor for [mental illness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032718319517).

When I got my first shot I felt like I had just taken the first step is some sort of addiction recovery process. As if I had chosen to take a new path in life. The first shot was the start of the process and the second would be a validation that I had changed my ways. It sounds weird, but after learning about this mental state maybe I'm not so crazy.
