"...the board has decided to dismantle the organization in its current state and end the lease on the Clubâ€™s physical space. The board believes the club should be reconstituted in a new, more inclusive form, under different leadership in the future."

This is in response to [the TDC called out recently for racist perspectives and practices](https://medium.com/@juan_kafka/my-resignation-from-the-type-directors-club-1023065b4853 "My Resignation from the Type Directors Club") by a former board member Juan Villanueva. He writes, "I hate burning bridges but the bridge of racism needs to burn."
