An adapted and updated excerpt from former President Barack Obama’s new memoir, [A Promised Land](https://www.amazon.com/Promised-Land-Barack-Obama/dp/1524763160) published by _The Atlantic_. Which includes this thought from Obama about writing while he drafted his presidential memoirs:

> I still like writing things out in longhand, finding that a computer gives even my roughest drafts too smooth a gloss and lends half-baked thoughts the mask of tidiness.

I haven't written anything by hand in so long I don't know what I might be missing. I do know that slowing down and getting better at editing has helped reduce the number of my own half-baked thoughts.
