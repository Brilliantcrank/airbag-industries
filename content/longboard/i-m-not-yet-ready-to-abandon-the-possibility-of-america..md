+++
An adapted and updated excerpt from former President Barack Obamaâ€™s new memoir, [A Promised Land](https://www.amazon.com/Promised-Land-Barack-Obama/dp/1524763160) published by _The Atlantic_. Which includes this thought from Obama about writing while he drafted his presidential memoirs:

> I still like writing things out in longhand, finding that a computer gives even my roughest drafts too smooth a gloss and lends half-baked thoughts the mask of tidiness.

I haven't written anything by hand in so long I don't know what I might be missing. Though it does not share any insights into his process, here's [an interesting story on Obama's literary past](https://lithub.com/how-obamas-reading-shaped-his-writing/) including authoring his first book, [_Dreams From My Father_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00573YVVY).
