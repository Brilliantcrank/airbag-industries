Tired of reading about NFT already? Here's a swell alternativeâ€”a quarterly zine in which [Rob Weychert](https://robweychert.com/) explores algorithmic art with a focus on [combinatorics](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar/crowds/crowds-1/v/intro-crowds) (as explained by Pixar animators). This is such a cool project. I especially love the first issue based on a gift Rob made for friends may years ago. If you don't follow Mr. Weychert you need to. He's one fo the most creative designer/developers on the planet.
