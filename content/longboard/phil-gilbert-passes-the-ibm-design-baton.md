If you ever wanted to see what real legacy looks like, read through all of the comments in response to Phil’s announcement on LinkedIn. Phil and his team built the [IBM Design](https://vimeo.com/256258448) program to scale the practice of user-centered design throughout a technology giant with 400k employees working in 160+ countries around the world. It started with a hundred or so designers and is now around three thousand—and hundreds more have come and gone.

The torch will pass to [Katrina Alcorn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrinaalcorn/), Head of Design for Autodesk. Up until now I had not heard of her but I'm sure she was run through the gauntlet to get this role. I wish her nothing but good luck as she is about to inherit one hell of a team and a global design program without its equal.
