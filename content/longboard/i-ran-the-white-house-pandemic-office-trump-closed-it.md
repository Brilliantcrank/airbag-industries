An op-ed piece from Beth Cameron, former senior director for global health security and biodefense on the White House National Security Council:

> When President Trump took office in 2017, the White Houseâ€™s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense survived the transition intact. Its mission was the same as when I was asked to lead the office, established after the Ebola epidemic of 2014: to do everything possible within the vast powers and resources of the U.S. government to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic.
> 
> One year later, I was mystified when the White House [dissolved the office](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/10/top-white-house-official-in-charge-of-pandemic-response-exits-abruptly/?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&itid=lk_inline_manual_2 "www.washingtonpost.com"), leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like covid-19.

No doubt part of the Drain the Swamp Make America Great Again initiative. Now we're living in a swamp and America doesn't feel so great. Nice work.
