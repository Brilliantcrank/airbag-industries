The one hundred and twenty eight questions that people must know as part of their application for citizenship. 

> These questions cover important topics about American government and history. The civics test is an oral test and the USCIS \[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\] officer will ask you to answer 20 out of the 128 civics test questions. You must answer at least 12 questions (or 60%) correctly to pass the 2020 version of the civics test.

When the Karens and Terrys shout at minorities to go home they should be given the citizenship test to see if they have what it takes to live in "America." And if they fail, perhaps a lovely evening at an ICE detention center to help them reflect on their anger and actions.
