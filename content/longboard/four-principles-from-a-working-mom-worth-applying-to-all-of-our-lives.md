"I’m a professor who teaches and a consultant who advises various organizations, married to a committed working spouse \[and\] the mom of four children: the oldest is seven; the youngest is just over six months old. 

I’ve come to believe that the difference between going to bed feeling content or disappointed at the end of the day has a lot to do with the expectations we set for ourselves. Let’s lower our standards. Better yet: Let’s use this moment to shift them to something more reasonable."

Solid advice from a mom who knows a thing or two about the hustle.
