Religion, no matter what the source, will inevitably tear everything apart once an ounce of fanaticism forms. And that's what QAnon is, a fervent-fanatical belief in false stories that people want to believe are true and live by that information as if it is. What I don't get is how profoundly stupid these stories are, and yet a good portion of this company can't subscribe fast enough. 

It would appear that common sense is dead.
