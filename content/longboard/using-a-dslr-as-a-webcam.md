While working with Jesse I noticed that his video looked remarkably better than mine. In this post, he documents his entire setup which includes a [Sony A6000](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digitial-3-0-Inch-16-50mm/dp/B00I8BICB2/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=sony+a6000&qid=1584117604&s=electronics&sr=1-3). Cool setup! I'm going to dig into this and make improvements to the Airbag headquarters.
