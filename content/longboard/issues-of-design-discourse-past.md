And on this day the design community received a gift from the heavens in the form of [_Emigre_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigre_(magazine)) magazine, for free.

> The final six issues of Emigre magazine, co-published with Princeton Architectural Press from 2003-2005, are now available as free PDF downloads from the Emigre website. These six pocket-book sized volumes were a final effort by Emigre to highlight and encourage critical writing within graphic design. We believed that design, as a cultural force, was worthy of an evaluative look, so we turned an inquisitive eye on our profession. All six issues have sold out years ago. We’re now making them available for free to anybody who’d like to revisit or who missed the excitement of the often heated debates that were circulating within graphic design during the early years of the 21st century.

If you liked Emigre and want more of that type of writing consider the digital publications [_Design Observer_](https://designobserver.com) and [_Brand New_](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/)_,_ and [_Eye_](http://www.eyemagazine.com) magazine—which just published its 100th issue.
