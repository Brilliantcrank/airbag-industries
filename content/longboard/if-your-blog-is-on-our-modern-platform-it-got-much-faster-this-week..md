Scott Fennell, my co-woker at LexBlog posted on Google’s Core Web Vitals (CWV) a “new set of website performance measurements authored by Google \[that measures\] the way a website actually behaves for a human user, rather than assess things that might look statistically significant to a machine.” Core Web Vitals will have an impact on search results beginning sometime in May 2021.
