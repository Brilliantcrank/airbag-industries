Trying to stop globalization is like trying to hold back nature.

> In recent years a different type of globalisation has accelerated. A new design aesthetic is taking over the world, spread not via brands or FDI \[foreign direct investment\], but through social media and the internet. Even as formal trade slows, the globalisation of taste is rampant. Starbucks may not have reached large chunks of the world, but there are very few large cities in the world now in which a visitor cannot order a latte surrounded by exposed wood and vintage light bulbs. Kabul boasts no McDonaldâ€™s, but you can get a decent burger and fries at Burger House, a restaurant that would not be out of place in San Francisco.

It does my heart good to see other cultures progressing _without_ global brands dictating what's in or out. This is the way.
