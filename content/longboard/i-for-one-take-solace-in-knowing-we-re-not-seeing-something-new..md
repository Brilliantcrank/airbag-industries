My head nodded in agreement when I read this statement by John on his blog, _Daring Fireball_. In his post, John quotes a passage from an article written by Richard Hofstadter for _Harper's_ magazine in November 1964. [The Paranoid Style in American Politics](https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/) describes a politically charged, divided country. While reading the paragraph, it is easy to imagine Richard wrote the article just yesterday to describe our current climate. While the 1960s did not contain a pandemic, other events turned the country into a powder keg: The Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Protests, and the assassinations of President Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Senator Kennedy. I hope we never get to the point of mirroring all of the events from that time, but I too take a measure of comfort that the United States has been through tough times like these before.
