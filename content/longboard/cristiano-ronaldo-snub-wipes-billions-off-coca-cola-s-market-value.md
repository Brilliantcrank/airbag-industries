I love this. Ronaldo, the top soccer player in the world, sits down at press conference. In front of him are two bottles of Coke products and one bottle of water. Before he says a thing, Ronaldo moves the Coke bottles away from him, picks up the bottle of water, and says, "Agua!"

Coke lost $4B in market capitalization within 24 hours.
