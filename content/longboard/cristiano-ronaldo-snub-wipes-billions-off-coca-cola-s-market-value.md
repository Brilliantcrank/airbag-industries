I love this. Ronaldo, the top soccer player in the world, sits down at a press conference. In front of him are two bottles of Coke products and one bottle of water. Before he says a thing, Ronaldo moves the Coke bottles away from him and out of camera view. He then picks up the bottle of water and says, "Agua!"

Within 24 hours, Coca-Cola lost $4B in market capitalization.
