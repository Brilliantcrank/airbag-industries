This might kill the Nintendo Switch for me because it would allow me to reduce the number of devices I have. And while I enjoy Nintendo, they aren't releasing any new games that I find compellingâ€”I'm not a fanboy and rarely play through anything twice. The only thing that might change my mind is of Microsoft brings their Gold Pass service to iPad.
