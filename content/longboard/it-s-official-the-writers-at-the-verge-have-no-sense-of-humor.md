Publishing no less than [three](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357166/volkswagen-name-change-voltswagen-us-division) [articles](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201179/april-fools-day-2020-is-canceled) on their sour position against April Fools jokes by brands, and going as far as calling such pranks a "lie to your customers." Yep, that's a bit much. Take off your cardigans, put down the apple sauce, look away from Jepordary re-runs, go play with the kids on your lawn, and lighten-up.
