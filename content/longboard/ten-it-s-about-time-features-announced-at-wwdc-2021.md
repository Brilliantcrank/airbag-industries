A good list from Tidbits. Several seem to be trying to get macOS and iOS in shape to support people working from home. I got excited about all the upgrades to notes, including @mentions, until I realized it might not work as universally as it does in applications like Slack. Apple allows users to create a shared ecosystem as a “family,” and I can invite individuals to collaborate on a single document. Still, I’m not aware of a way to create a “company” that brings with it a directory of everyone in the company. In other words, macOS and iOS, despite having pro features, are not geared to set up a company network for collaboration. I would be delighted to be proven wrong. As Google becomes more corrupt, relying on them to supply collaborative tools continues to build up risk. And the tipping point is coming soon.
