From the editors of Wired magazine:

> Climate change. Flawed algorithms. Deadly diseases. Tech monopolies. We are facing many existential challenges that need to be tackled head-on before it’s too late. Many of these problems [are of our own making](https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-work-together-fix-mess-we-made), consequences of our relentless push for progress. Fortunately, there are lots of people who are racing to save us from ourselves—progress we can definitely get behind.

It's great to see Wired getting back into its game, and on these topics.
