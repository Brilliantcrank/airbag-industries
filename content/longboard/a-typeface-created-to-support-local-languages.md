> Charis SIL is a Unicode-based font family that supports the wide range of languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. It is specially designed to make long texts pleasant and easy to read, even in less than ideal reproduction and display environments.

The type family was developed by [SIL International](https://www.sil.org/about/discover), a faith based organization that supports “ethnolinguistic minority communities as they build their capacity for the sustainable development of their own languages.” The organization was founded on the principal that communities should be able to pursue their social, cultural, political, economic and spiritual goals without sacrificing their language.

Not only does it look great, Charis SIL is “free to use, modify, and redistribute according to the terms of the [SIL Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ofl).
