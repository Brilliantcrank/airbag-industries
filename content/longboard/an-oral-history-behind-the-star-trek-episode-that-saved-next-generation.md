A fun read with a kicker!

> As great as "Yesterday's Enterprise" is, it is a source of some regret for one of its key creative architects.

> "I wish we did this as the plot for _Generations_," Moore says, referencing the first _Star Trek_ feature film [featuring _The Next Generation_ crew](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/how-star-trek-generations-killed-franchise-1255759) that he co-wrote with Brannon Braga. "If we hadn't have done that episode, then \[the movie\] would have been the Enterprise-A coming through that wormhole, and you'd have Spock and Kirk and everyone on that ship, we'd play the same story. They — the original crew — they had to go back to their deaths. And Guinan knew Kirk, and Guinan knew Picard, and that would have been an amazing movie."

Can you imagine? I agree with Brannon, this plot would have made a fantastic film. There is a lot behind this one storyline that a cinematic format could have addressed so much better.
