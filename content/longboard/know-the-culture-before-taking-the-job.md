The fight to retain work-from-home privileges has just begun. I am surprised by the group of Apple employees resisting coming back to work three days a week. Their culture has a symbiotic relationship to place for a long time. This was most certainly the case at 1 Infinite Loop and I have to imagine it’s even more so at Apple Park.

I can hear John now as if he’s reading his post: 

> Who are these people who took jobs at Apple not knowing the company’s on-site culture? Do they think Apple built a new $4 billion campus on a lark? Three days a week on-site and two days remote is a *huge* change for Apple.

> Companies are not democracies, but the employees writing these letters sure seem to think Apple is one. It’s not, and if it were, the company would sink in a snap. Apple’s new “three days on-site” policy wasn’t a request for comments—it was a decision—and Tim Cook’s company-wide letter already leaves room for individual teams to adjust it to their own needs.

I get pushing back on returning to work at an old, stodgy Enterprise company where the workplace is not extraordinary. Apple Park is a huge exception. That place is like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory—you can't replace that with a home office.

As for companies not being democracies, I wonder how long before a few more groups in Silicon Valley or Seattle, or Austin will try to stand up a union in response to returning to the workplace.
