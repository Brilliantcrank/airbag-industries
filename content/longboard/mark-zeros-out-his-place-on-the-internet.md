> From this foundational reset, I’m hoping this is the start of a continual work in progress. A return to blogging my thoughts. Just writing things down. A place I can experiment, document, design, and look back on. Already it’s a place I’m visually happier with. It feels right. It feels _me_.

Bold colors, great typography and a strong composition is all you need.
