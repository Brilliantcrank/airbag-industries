Anders Norén, a top theme designer (one of my top three) on the user interface (UI) of the popular CMS:

> We’ve gotten used to that mess, and since we’ve navigated it daily for years until it’s become second nature to us – but it is still a mess. In comparison, services like Squarespace have gradually improved until they now offer site owners more control over the structure and design of their site than the out-of-box WordPress experience while still being more user friendly.

He’s not wrong. The WordPress interface looks more like legacy Enterprise software than a modern-day application. Given that Automattic employs amazing designers like Jeffrey Zeldman and Bethany Heck, I know they have the talent to make a significant emprovement.
