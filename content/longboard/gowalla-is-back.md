Feels like there is rarely good news about the Internet these days. Maybe that’s why this morning’s news of the return of Gowalla was especially welcome.

[Gowalla was a beloved iOS application.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowalla) It was one of the first to encourage real-world exploration by rewarding users to register or check-into the place they were visiting. Places could be anything from a park to a public building to the corner watering hole. The quality of the design  was second to none and featured an ever-expanding catalog of icons illustrated by [Brian Brasher.](https://etherbrian.org) A lot of work went into the brand that extended beyond the digital experience. It was warm, welcome, and made travel–of all kinds—more fun.

Unfortunately, it didn’t take long for a competing experience to appear in the form of Foursquare which paired business check-ins with coupons. It was ugly and lacked personality, but the value proposition of savings a dollar off a margarita was enough to attract more users. Gowalla was shut down in 2012.

This morning a tweet from an old Twitter account announced the return of Gowalla though with [a different experience based on augmented reality.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/gowalla-is-getting-resurrected-as-an-augmented-reality-social-app/) I’m just glad to have it back. It’s so great to see the Gowalla brand and its kangaroo back in the world.
