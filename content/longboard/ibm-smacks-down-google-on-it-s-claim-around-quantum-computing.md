> A paper from Google leaked last month claimed its researchers had achieved “quantum supremacy.” Now IBM says Google rigged the test.

A quick read reveals early support for IBMs claim.

> Jonathan Dowling, a professor at Louisiana State University, says IBM appears to have some merit. “Google picked a problem they thought to be really hard on a classical machine, but IBM now has demonstrated that the problem is not as hard as Google thought it was,” he says.

As a fellow IBMer it makes me feel good to see Big Blue getting into a bit of a street fight here. While I didn't work with the quantum computing folks directly, I followed some of their work and it's truly badass—IBM doing what their brand always makes me think of: Deep research and development into the future.
