Seth Godin shares a tiny bit of wisdom this morning:

> Some people hesitate to share an idea because they’re worried it will be stolen. In general, these people are afraid of success, not failure. An idea unspoken is a safe one, which not only can’t be stolen, but it can’t be tested, criticized, improved or used in the real world.

I can only think of one type of regret that a person can have when they are old, and that's not putting their ideas out there and giving them a try.
