Julia Evans writes, "When I learn something that helps me, I write about it so that it can help other people too."

I give this advice to people I coach because writing also helps you process what you have learned. A secondary benefit is that it can help others who are learning the same thing. Writing about what you are learning is also a great way to start to gain followers. Finally, in sharing your thoughts through writing, you're expressing vulnerability which is still very difficult for many people.

Julia's advice is especially poignant to everyone in the midst of a career change. Be hungry, stay curious, and write about everything you discover.
