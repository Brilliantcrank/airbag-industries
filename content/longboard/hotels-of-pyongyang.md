A glimpse of well preserved North Korean hospitality architecture (interior and exteriors) heavenly influenced by 1970's China, East Germany, and the Soviet Union. Looks like a bunch of Wed Anderson film sets without the heavy use of Futura.

The photos are from a [new book](https://www.hotelsofnorthkorea.com/store) published out of Australia.
