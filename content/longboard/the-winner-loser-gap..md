> After adjusting for demographic differences across countries, they estimated a 7% fall in satisfaction with democracy for a typical loser and a 6% rise for a typical winner (using an employed person of middle age and average education as their baseline)...models reckon that this effect is similar across the continent, regardless of a country’s electoral system. Strikingly, they also found signs of a winner-loser gap in the levels of trust citizens say they have in other respects—in parliament and politicians; the courts and police; and even in other people in general.

Just in case you were thinking our political problems around the planet were simple. I'd love to see a correlation of this data against trust in corporations.
