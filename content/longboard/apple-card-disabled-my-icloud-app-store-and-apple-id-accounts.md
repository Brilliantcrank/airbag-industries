> My bank account number changed in January, causing Apple Card autopay to fail. Then the Apple Store made a charge on the card. Less than fifteen days after that, my App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple ID accounts had all been disabled by Apple Card.

He also forgot to mail in a MacBook trade-in for a new laptop purchase he made, which compounded the problem.   
  
This all seemed to have caused what I would consider the perfect storm for a multi-tiered Apple user (credit, services, products). I'm posting this here to help spread the word but to also serve as a reminder in case something like this happens to me.
