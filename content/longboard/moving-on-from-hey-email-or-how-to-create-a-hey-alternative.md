I loved the Screener feature, which lets me decide who I want to receive e-mails from and who I want to block from emailing me again, forever. I also found Imbox (used for real person-to-person talk), The Feed (used for newsletter and related stuff), and Paper Trail (used for receipts and confirmations) concepts pretty useful.

Franco goes on to provide a detailed instructions on how he replicated the features of Hey that he liked through "contact groups, message folders, and sorting rules." If you're looking for an alternative to Hey, this is it.
