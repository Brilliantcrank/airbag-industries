Do you have a penis and identify as he/him? Then I suggest purchasing, reading, and reflecting on this book. It was recommended in a group call by a bad-ass female leader in response to a question on how men can be better—and appropriate—supporters of women at work.

The authors, W. Brad Johnson and David G. Smith, work at the United States Naval Academy and the United States Naval War College, respectively. They have also written on the topic of [inclusive mentorship](https://store.hbr.org/product/athena-rising-how-and-why-men-should-mentor-women/10378?sku=10378E-KND-ENG). Here they are [presenting their argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE17Ws5aAqQ) that supporting women in the workplace results in a stronger business with larger profits and properly supporting women at work.
