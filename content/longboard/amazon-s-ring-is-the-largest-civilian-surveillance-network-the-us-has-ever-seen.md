> One in 10 US police departments can now access videos from millions of privately owned home security cameras without a warrant. In a 2020 letter to \[Amazon\] management, Max Eliaser, an [Amazon software engineer](https://amazonemployees4climatejustice.medium.com/amazon-employees-share-our-views-on-company-business-f5abcdea849), said Ring is “simply not compatible with a free society”.

I bet half the idiots who decry wearing a face mask as an affront to their constitutionally protected freedoms have an Amazon Ring installed. If this doesn’t scare you a little bit, it should.
