Quick note, if you're not following Mr. Ruperts blog then get on it. Moving on, Dave shares a lesson learned on blogging:

> I made a mistake. Three weeks ago I settled into a nice blogging flow and had a decent stream of published posts. It felt so good to get ideas out of my head. Sitting on a handful of nearly done posts, I was putting the finishing touches on one of my precious thoughvomits, I got the bright idea to spice it up by adding some illustrations…

I chuckled because I did this about a year ago inspired by blogs that use Unsplash to add an image to every post. It's easy to search for a photo, but illustrations not so much. I concur with Dave's thoughts including his conclusion—"Don’t do this."
