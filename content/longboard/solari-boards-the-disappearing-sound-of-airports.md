It's not just the sound, but the visual of all the cards—all the data—spinning until the right combination of information is found. These signs are also known as [split-flat displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display "Wikipedia entry for split-flat displays") and found in many train stations (in Europe anyway). It's a shame to read they are being phased out.
