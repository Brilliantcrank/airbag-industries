For anyone in the online publishing business considering memberships of any and all kind comes this handy resource from a project called the [Membership Puzzle Project.](https://membershippuzzle.org/articles-overview/introducing-membership-guide)

> In partnership with [The Lenfest Institute](http://lenfestinstitute.org/) and the [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/) — released the Membership Guide. It is the culmination of three years of study and support for membership models in news. The Guide is like a little course in membership. It takes you through the steps. It tells you how to do each one. It identifies best practices. It warns about common mistakes. And it gathers into one place the lessons people have learned as they built their membership programs— including, of course, the errors and wrong turns. We spent six months pulling it all together, we consulted a lot of knowledgeable people to make sure we had it right, we talked to 50+ newsrooms — or individuals and organizations supporting newsrooms — on five continents, and we’re excited to share the results with you now.

While the site is a considerable resource, I would also recommend creating and updating a [Business Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) to help in this process.
