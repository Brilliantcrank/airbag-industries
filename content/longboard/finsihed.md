> The myriad of tiny design decisions that culminate to create a story of ‘brand’ in a product jokingly destroyed by a stupid typo. A really lazy ‘should’ve been picked up in QA’typo. So this week, I’m focussed on the little things. The things that often get forgotten about. The things that, when they’re all added together, tell the story of a product more effectively than any marketing campaign. It’s where we should be spending our time.

Amen.

Misspelling and unfinished sentences are why I harp on my co-workers to use applications like Grammarly to help find errors or get someone to help with editing. One missed detail is an indication that there are more.

Nice catch Mark.
