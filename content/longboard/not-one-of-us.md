Jeffrey reminds us that despite our differences, we all need humanity.

> Even the most privileged among us are living with trauma.
>
>   
> Not one of us has escaped. Not one is unchanged.
>
>   
> Take a moment to be gentle with yourself, and with all whom you encounter. Even the monsters are crying inside.

Amen.
