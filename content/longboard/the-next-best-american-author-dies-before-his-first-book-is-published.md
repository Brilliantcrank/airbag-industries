Enough dying already, @#$%! Unfortunately I had not heard of Anthony Veasna So until coming across this weird biography/obituary piece in the Times. Intrigued by what I read, I headed over to literary magazine [N+1](https://nplusonemag.com) and started reading So’s short story, [_Superking Son Scores Again—The Magic Johnson of badminton_](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-31/fiction-drama/superking-son-scores-again/). I’m not all the way through, but already I’m hooked on his storytelling, and I’m pissed that such a great talent is gone. I’ve pre-ordered Anthony’s book, [_Afterparties: Stories_](https://bookshop.org/books/afterparties-stories/9780063049901), and I can already tell I’ll want more when I’m done.
