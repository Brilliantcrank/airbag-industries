David Perell, shares his method of writing apparently based on this snippet from [an interview with Seinfeld](https://podclips.com/m/W6PpV8) (I write that because the post does not include a citation or link to the statement quoted—still it's good advice).

> Writing and editing should be separate activities.

> When I’m in this creation mode, I shoot for a flow state. I keep my fingertips on the keyboard and measure progress by how many words I put on the page. I have one rule: write down every epiphany immediately. The more, the merrier.

> If this creation mode is defined by quantity, the subsequent editing mode is defined by quality.

This is the way.

I've known a few folks who edit while they write, and it takes them forever just to knock out a sentence. The kind of flow kills creativity, and it's highly likely that's what gets in the way of so many people writing more frequently.

My initial drafts are a disaster—as are the second and third—but I'm driving to get as much out of my head as possible. Even after editing as much as I can find on my own, I still rely on Grammarly to help. I use the app to clean up my assault on the English language. And it helps me recognize bad patterns in my writing. Over the last two years, I can genuinely say that the application finds fewer mistakes to correct these days.
