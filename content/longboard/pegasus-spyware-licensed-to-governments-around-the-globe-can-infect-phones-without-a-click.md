Developed to track bad people, it’s instead being used to track journalists, human rights activist, and business executives. Not cool.

> Military-grade spyware licensed by an Israeli firm to governments for tracking terrorists and criminals was used in attempted and successful hacks of 37 smartphones belonging to journalists, human rights activists, business executives and two women close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to an investigation by The Washington Post and 16 media partners.
>
> The phones appeared on a list of more than 50,000 numbers that are concentrated in countries known to engage in surveillance of their citizens and also known to have been clients of the Israeli firm, NSO Group, a worldwide leader in the growing and largely unregulated private spyware industry.

While the world turns into an idiots version of Lord of the Flies and we are primarily distracted, our rights and freedoms are being subverted through the technology we increasingly rely upon daily. And yet, these stories that should be a major alarm on the scale of rampant nuclear armament will go ignored because it’s not tactile enough, yet, to be politicized and turned into sound bites for the journalism equivalent of wrestling entertainment that is cable news.

Also, I had a hunch all of those free bible apps that make up 80% of the Google Play store were a little suspicious.
