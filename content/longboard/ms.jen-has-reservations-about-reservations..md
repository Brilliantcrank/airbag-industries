> I would rather wait for a half hour or so for a table to come available at a favorite restaurant, people watch, talk to the random folks who are also waiting, etc. than make a reservation, go to the table, and have everything be a little too perfect with no opportunity for life or spontaneity to happen.

I'm not a fan of reservations either and glad to see I'm not alone. Also, I'm now in awe that Jen was able to walk-in to French Laundry. ADHD Achievement unlocked.
