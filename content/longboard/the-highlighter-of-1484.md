Working on three different branding projects, I have browsed through a good deal of type families lately. Most families contain a fair amount of glyphs (boxes, stars, etc.) but on occasion, I’ve come across the symbol of a pointing hand. I didn’t think much about its use until recently after coming across the article [“Point, don’t point.”](https://ilovetypography.com/2020/01/27/typographic-manicules-point-dont-point/ "Point, don't point.")

> \[The\] pointed-finger symbol goes by many names: mutton fist, printer’s fist, bishop’s fist, pointer, hand director, indicule, or most unimaginatively as "a hand." Scholarly consensus has pretty much settled on the word "manicule", from the Latin maniculum, meaning "little hand."

Scribes and scholars—sometimes readers—used a manicule to “emphasize a significant word, phrase or passage” much like how readers today use a highlighter. [FF Franziska](http://fffranziska.com "FF Franziska"), the type family used in the upcoming Airbag design refresh has such a mark and now I am intrigued on how to incorporate it here in the future.
