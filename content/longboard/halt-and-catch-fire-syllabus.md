> This series covers the history of computers from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. But more than just technical innovation, it manages to center the people in it, including power dynamics. Thereâ€™s a lot that we can cover about gender, class, and race and how they interact with each other. Those ideas are important. Characters are important to talk about when they are generalizing these larger ideas. That being said, this syllabus does not intend to take a film theory approach to analyzing the intentions behind characters at a personal level, but takes the approach of how these behaviors are symptomatic of larger structural, societal issues.

I heart everything about this project by Ashley Blewer, especially the 'zine vibe for each issue. This would only be made better if it was hosted on an ASCII BBS accessible only via Telnet.
