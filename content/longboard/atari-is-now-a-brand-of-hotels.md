From the [official website](https://atarihotels.com "Atari Hotels"): "Atari Hotels level up hotel entertainment with fully immersive experiences for every age and gaming ability, including the latest in Virtual and Augmented Reality." It makes sense to integrate a hotel around these entertainment options given the popularity of gaming. But only if the tech and content are constantly updated. Otherwise, it will end up like today's movie theater lobbies rocking Time Crisis II and Sega OutRun.
