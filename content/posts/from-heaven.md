Growing up in Alaska there weren’t that many opportunities to root for the home team. Sure we had amateur sports but the only thing that made national television was the Iditarod.  

And nobody wears t-shirts or decorates their vehicles for their favorite dog musher.  

So now that I am ten miles from Disneyland just having a major league home team is a new experience, let alone a team that is the <span class="caps">MLB</span> American League Champions and soon to be World Series Champion, Anaheim Angels.  

Last week my brother (now living near Oakland) gave me a hard time because I was getting excited over the Angels and baseball in general. He asked me when did I start liking baseball?  

I didn’t have a good answer for him then, but I do now.  

I started liking baseball when the Angel’s made it to the World Series and his Oakland A’s didn’t.
