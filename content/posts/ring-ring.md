— Hello?  

— Hey, it’s your Right Kidney calling. How are you?  

— Uh, I’m ok. Why do you ask?  

— A few of us down here noticed you’ve been drinking a lot of water lately. It’s like a freaking monsoon season down here. What’s going on?  

— Oh, that. I’ve been sick. Hey, who’s that talking in the background?  

— That’s your Bladder. He wants you to know that he’s put in ten hours of overtime this week. And another thing, we’ve both noticed you haven’t had an iced latte in a while.  

— Yeah, I’m supposed to drink water and orange juice.  

— Hey you don’t have to tell me pal, the Left Kidney thinks she’s on vacation in Florida with all the <span class="caps">OJ</span> you’ve been drinking. She’s a little loopy anyway. If you ever have to donate a kidney, don’t hesitate with that one.  

— Do you guys ever talk to the Lungs?  

— Not really, they think they’re so cool being next to the Heart and all. Why, are they giving you trouble?  

— Trouble? Pffft. More like hell.  

— Asshats! Hey listen I just got word that another 12 oz. of water is coming down the pike, I gotta get back to work. You take care okay? And do us all a favor and crawl your way to Starbucks as soon as you can. We’re all going through withdrawal down here.  

— Will do. Later.
