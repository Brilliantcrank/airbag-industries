I am having communication problems with the good people of Canada. There is a problem with my registration of airbag.ca. I’m not sure if they want me off their ‘lands’ or just clarification of registration information.  

The domain you all know and love may come to an abrupt end if I am unable to break the language barrier and smoke a peace pipe. Otherwise it’s curtains for this Canadian domain.  

Should that unfortunate event occur you can find this site via a new domain: [airbagindustries.com](http://www.airbagindustries.com "New domain name! Tell everyone you know!") — an address I had set aside for an entirely different purpose, to be announced at a later date.
