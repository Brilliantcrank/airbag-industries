Today the WWF (group of sweaty men) lost to the WWF (the animal kingdom) in an Intellectual Property lawsuit. How wonderful it is to see the fight for a good cause, World Wildlife Fund for Nature corkscrew the home of Hulk Hogan and Mr. T tagteam.  

So many times the institution with the largest pocketbook (eToys) beats out the smaller, work for a living operations (eToy) because they can simply outspend the little guy.  

I understand this case was not about money but Trademarks are property for a reason, and on this day, the panda bears, siberian tigers, and elephants got to keep a most valuable asset.
