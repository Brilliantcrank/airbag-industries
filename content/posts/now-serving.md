Sometime today Airbag will move to a new server with new services such as PHP and MySQL. There may be an outage, just as a comet might hit me where I stand, in other words possible but not probable.  

Once everything is moved and at home, I’ll start tinkering with some cool MT plugins that were previously not available.  

A few days ago I fixed a problem with the footer being nested in the wrong box. You may have noticed the layout broke with shorter entries. There is still the problem with the right hand column breaking here and there. I’ve noticed the problem after entering comments but can’t find what’s causing it.  

And finally I need to finish some new graphics and layouts to be used on secondary pages.
