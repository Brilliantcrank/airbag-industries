Happy anniversary everyone! I can’t believe it’s been five years already but look at how much has been Mission Accomplished. Gosh, how we were able to get through the day without being boots down in Iraq, I’ll never know.  

Among all the other happy financial news of late it was certainly delightful to read that [Bush’s initial cost estimates for the Iraq War have turned out to be just one-tenth of the actual cost.](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/washington/19cost.html?ref=world)

> At the outset of the Iraq war, the Bush administration predicted that it would cost $50 billion to $60 billion to oust Saddam Hussein, restore order and install a new government.  
> 
> Five years in, the Pentagon tags the cost of the Iraq war at roughly $600 billion and counting. Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and critic of the war, pegs the long-term cost at more than $4 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office and other analysts say that $1 trillion to $2 trillion is more realistic, depending on troop levels and on how long the American occupation continues.

Two trillion (and that’s just money, lets not forget all of the people who have died or are now wounded for life). That is fan-tas-tic! Absolutely brilliant. I mean, how did we get so lucky to have such great leadership? God bless America?! <span class="caps">OMG</span> it’s so, so true.  

Now, I could be wrong here but if the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of any company in the world was to run costs through the roof like this he’d be kicked out on his ass and no one would think twice about it.  

You would think that after one year we would have been unsettled enough to kick Shrub out on his head, but after five years? We should all be ashamed of ourselves.  

Now, are we having cake for this anniversary or maybe someone brought cup cakes?
