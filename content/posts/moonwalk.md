If ever I am convicted of a crime whereby I have to go to trial I would like to go ahead and reserve the same jury that found Michael Jackson not guilty of any wrong doing. Because if those twelve numbnuts are able to cast a blind eye towards the evidence against the King of Pop then I have nothing to lose with them as my “peers.”  

Letting OJ Simpson walk free, I get that — If they had found him guilty half of Los Angeles would still be a pile of ash, it was a very tense time. But I can’t imagine anyone feared rioting and chaos if they had found Michael guilty of anything. I can only assume that each juror is now the proud partial owner of the Beatles catalog.  

Beat it indeed.
