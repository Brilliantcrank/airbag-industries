Not that we are without anything to do on this fine Tuesday (quite the contrary) but Ryan had an interesting idea to see how long it would take to get a response to a post in Twitter. He posted a simple request for his Twitter friends to send him an email and within seconds came several replies.  

Dusting off my account I posted a similar message and within five minutes had twenty-five replies, some responses coming from friends that I haven’t seen on IM in decades (well it feels like decades). Where have all of you good people been? On Twitter? Really?  

Apparently I’ve missed something.  

Also, on behalf of Ryan, Ethan, and I we thank you for joining our most recent multi-level marketing scheme and want you all to know that your free ($8.95 shipping/handling) dish soap and toilet bowl cleaner should arrive in five-to-ten days.
