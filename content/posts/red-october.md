It’s baseball season here, just Ten Miles to Disneyland.  

The Goodyear blimp was already doing doughnuts high above Angel’s Stadium (or Edison International Field) while I was on my way home from work. The fans were tailgating well before noon and vehicles everywhere are sporting anything that bears the Angels moniker where normally something <span class="caps">LA</span> Lakers would have been.  

Tonight, in the man room, the game is being observed from the Grundig world band radio. There’s something about baseball and AM radio that fits so well.  

The sun is setting off the horizon, the air is cooling to exactly the right temperature, and seasonal trees are beginning to shed their leaves.  

The world is civilized once again <span class="caps">…</span>  

<span class="caps">…</span> at least for another six innings.
