For the last six months the Rocket Scientist and I have had the privilege of living on the sixteenth floor of The Shore building in downtown Austin. Rented sight unseen, it was an unexpected surprise to discover the view this place has. Our unit in particular has unique perspective that allows us to see the five bridges (three motor, one pedestrian and one rail) over the Colorado River that lead into downtown Austin. While cars, trains and people head North and South, boats, crew teams, canoes and paddle boards scurry East and West on the water below. Activity everywhere. To cap it all off the sunset ties it all together in the perfect send-off to every day.  

Those who follow me on [Instagram](http://www.gramfeed.com/brilliantcrank), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brilliantcrank/) or [Tumblr](http://www.brilliantcrank.com) have already seen my chronicle of this view. For the rest of you, here is a sample of what I have seen and will miss soon.

On Tuesday afternoon we closed title on our next home in the South Congress neighborhood. By the end of the month weâ€™ll have a completely different view of Austin but nothing quite so high as our deluxe apartment in the sky.
